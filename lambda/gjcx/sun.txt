       SUN <-> LMI Interconnectivity.

23-Jul-86 17:50:45 -George Carrette


* SUN already supports diskless/terminaless processor/node configurations.
  The SUN only uses the ethernet:
  -> uses TFTP to get boot file Unix image. This is a IP/UDP protocol easy to implement.
  -> uses a proprietary (i.e. undocumented) raw ethernet (presumably) protocol called
     ND (network disk) for paging.
  -> uses NFS for file services.
  -> TELNET/RLOGIN type programs for user interaction.
  -> RPC (remote procedure call) used for NFS can also be used for tape,
     serial port and other device access.

This would suggest that a SUN processor could merely be in the same box
with an LMI processor, connect via ethernet. Perhaps having an internal
arragement much like the ethernet MANIFOLD such as the DEC DELNI. This
way the EXTERNAL view of the machine is reasonable. It looks like one box
with an optional ethernet connection to the outside world. The internal
ethernet is hidden.

NOTE: The performance of such an arrangement would be better than the present
      performance of our chaos-protocol based STREAMS implementation over the NuBus.
      Better in 3 areas:
      * throughput
      * processor overhead
      * closed loop reponse time, i.e. message turn around time.
      [This is the highly confidential statement. In fact it is comparing
       poorly implemented chaos via nubus with Excelan TCP, which is a highly
       buffered DMA device.]
However, limitations in our file system make the LMI a much less than ideal NFS
server. This is fixable, reasonable fixes in present file system and in a moby fs.
(Trivial in moby fs).

** FASTER COUPLING **

Proteon has VME bus 80-megabit fiber optic token ring, also multibus, unibus,
and customizable-module. If we dont really need PMAP (e.g. our present PMAP
capability is limited to 32 kbytes by hardcoded programming and
constants in lisp microcode and nobody has complained) then this would be
a very fast and general way to couple not only the SUN's but other computers
as well. (CRAY's, DEC's, IBM's).

** CLOSER COUPLING **

Given a NuBus <-> VME coupler such that:

[KIND A]. VME can master NuBus, read/write any NuBus memory it wants.
[KIND B]. NuBus can master VME, read/write any VME memory it wants.
[KIND C]. Both A and B capabilities.


What is possible?

With [KIND A] memory in NuBus with the help of a processor could
simulate a 3COM-like ethernet board. That is the SUN would see a 3COM
ethernet board on its VME bus. This board has multiple transmit and
receive buffers, but data must be copied word by word from the board
into the SUN's internal memory.  Given the processor power of the 68020
on the SUN this would result in reasonable performance. Also, a user
process in the SUN could use the PMAP system call to map certain
VME(actual NuBus) memory into its virtual address space. The resulting
situation is then extremely close to LMI's present LAMBDA-PLUS.
Simulating a MULTIPLE BUFFER ethernet board would allow much better
performance than our present situation with STREAMS/CHAOSNET.
Requirements: Small ethernet Device driver modifications on the SUN.

Side note: The IOP could perhaps do the work of simulating the 3COM-like
ethernet interface. Then if a packet is destined to go to a processor on
the NuBus it would do the obvious thing, and if destined to go out via
real ethernet it would also do the obvious thing. Perhaps it could even
handle the simple ND protocol since it also controls the disk.

With [KIND B] then the NuBus processor could still pull off the
simulated 3COM driver. Or also a driver such that a couple VME
locations are simulated device control registers for a device
that can DMA the data to/from the required location in arbitrary
places in VME memory. Main Limitation: PMAP'ed memory would reside
on the VME side, not the NuBus side. IOP may be hard pressed via side
note. Lisp processor would have to copy the data.
Requirements: Small ethernet Device driver modifications on the SUN.

With [KIND C] then we have either A or B capabilities. Which noteably are
not any different in results just in implementation.

Either way we are looking at having some amount of either NuBus of VME bus
memory. Both SUN and new lisp processor have private memory which is
also available from their standard bus.

The simplicity of doing a good job of the hardware (reliable, buildable) on
[A] or [B] over [C] might justify doing it very quickly.

Side note: Possible advantage to [A including NuBus clock] is that a full
featured SUN (disk etc) could boot the present and future lisp processors
without need for IOP, SDU etc.
