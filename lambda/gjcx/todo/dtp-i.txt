[SI:DTP-INDEXED-FORWARD][CDR-CODE][ADDRESS]

Should act like an invisible pointer into SI:*INDEXED-CELL-ARRAY*
which will be an ART-Q array. Like DTP-ONE-Q-FORWARD but with an index.

If DTP-INDEXED-FORWARD is seen then the machine will get the word
 (AREF SI:*INDEXED-CELL-ARRAY* ADDRESS)

If SI:*INDEXED-CELL-ARRAY* is not an array or not big enough then we should probably
signal a trap much like a DTP-TRAP error.

A suggestion: to return NIL since programs like the inspector will not expect to
find cells like SYMBOL-PLIST unbound. What about PUTPROP in this case?
Clearly it should be an error.

Or ADDRESS is actually [SEMANTICS][INDEX]
where [SEMANTICS] controls default behavior. e.g. 0 = unbound/trap, 1 = NIL.


Programs to worry about:
 * inspector, must have SYMBOL-PLIST-BOUNDP.
 * error handler. must have binding of SI:*INDEXED-CELL-ARRAY* from stack group being
   debugged.
 * special closures. Exactly what cell is going to be recorded as the internal value cell?
 * property lists, e.g.

        (call-data-type-not-equal pdl-top (a-constant (byte-value q-data-type dtp-symbol)) trap)
   (ERROR-TABLE ARGTYP SYMBOL PP T)
   (ERROR-TABLE ARG-POPPED 0 PP)
        (POPJ-AFTER-NEXT
         (M-T) DPB Q-POINTER PDL-POP
                (A-CONSTANT (BYTE-VALUE Q-DATA-TYPE DTP-LOCATIVE)))
       ((M-T) ADD M-T A-TEM1)


 Code from rplacd:
                           (LOCF (SYMBOL-PLIST SYMBOL-OR-PLIST))
                         SYMBOL-OR-PLIST))
           (RPLACD PLLOC (LIST*-IN-AREA (IF (= (%AREA-NUMBER SYMBOL-OR-PLIST) NR-SYM)

This gets the locative                     (LOCF (SYMBOL-PLIST SYMBOL-OR-PLIST))
 using XCL1 index (TEM1) = 3. But RPLACD should do
the right thing here.


Higher level constructs:

Given a symbol, allocate slots in SI:*INDEXED-CELL-ARRAY* for its value, function, and property lists.
Then copy the contents of those cells into the array. Then store DTP-INDEXED-FORWARD's into the
symbol.



 microcode dispatch tables effected.
 * many tables have INDEXED-FORWARD handled like what small float (which type used to be)
   used to do. FIX THESE.
