at the nfs "connectathon" we had back in january prior to our nfs exhibition
at uniforum we had a few vendors using ethernet hardware from Excelan.  if my
memory serves me correctly someone from Excelan came out with a network monitor
and in checking things out found some problems in the firmware they were
currently shipping...you might mention this to your Excelan support person.
Steve Issac, who manages our NFS consulting group can probably give more
complete (as well as more current) information.

as far as the 2048 byte max packets, there are now options to the mount command
in our version of UNIX which allow you to set the size so that a server doesn't
overrun a client's ability to slurp up packets (or vice versa).  check out the
manual pages for mount, umount, export, import, etc.

i have to plead ignorance on the system 5 compatibility issues...i remember
the system 5 microvax port was down to the wire and they were one of the groups
using the Excelan ethernet gear, but i can't recall much beyond that.

Well, I'm glad to hear that you are putting
NFS up on your machines! We actually got Excelan to put
9K UDP packets into their stuff. Talk to Grant Rostig
(408-434-2284) in Excelan support about this. Another
Excelan contact is Sid Aurora, a marketing person, who
we have worked with extensively on NFS things. Sid is
able to get things done quite effectively within the
Excelan organization.

Keep me informed on your progress.

re: XDR
--Text Follows This Line--
Its too bad that XDR doesnt bother to transmit the type of the object along with each object.
The overhead for small objects like XDR_INT might be a lot, but it appears that in actual
protocols that data is small compared with the amount in strings and counted byte arrays.
And of course one can always have a uniform array type, where all elements are of the
same type, so you transmit the length, the type, then the elements.

The engineering value of the error-checking capability provided by the extra info is considerable,
and the runtime cost certainly small compared with the network overhead.

[Now, isnt that just the kind of comment you'd expect from a lisp programmer.
 Typical. Introducing extra complexity like uniform arrays to get around the extra overhead
 of runtime type encoding.]

Even Barbara Liscov, Ms Compile-Time-Type-Checking personified, found she wanted to introduce
runtime type checking into the Argus language, the derivative of CLU for distributed computations.

Be that as it may, you might be interested in how the XDR library takes shape under lisp.
The very clever and clean convention useful in the C language implementation, with
reflexive primitives that do both the encode and decode operation, which makes it possible
for the user to directly define compound data structure representation in a single procedure,
does not work out very well in lisp. There is no clean and efficient "&" construct.
So XDR_INT and XDR_ARRAY and XDR_U_INT etc are out. Instead I have two primitives,

 XDR_TRANSMIT(XDRS,OBJECT,TYPE)

 XDR_RECEIVE(XDRS,TYPE)

e.g. XDR_TRANSMIT(stream,555,INTEGER)

also

      {int x;
       x = XDR_RECEIVE(stream,INTEGER);}



The TYPE is of course available at runtime and is dispatched on by the transmit and receive routines.
Then since, to quote page 35 of the "External Data Representation Protocol Specification"

  "The XDR standard also suggests a language to describe data."

I in fact implement such a language. Ignoring the next statement:

 "The language is a bastardized C; it is a data description language, not a programming language."


Instead the language is bastardized Lisp (which is a redundant adjective to use) which is
of course both a data description language and a programming language.

"." is really outside of the scope of the protocol, and is really an
artifact of Unix.  Unix uses the "." as a placeholder for the current
working directory, and uses ".." as the parent directory. These aren't
technically parts of the protocol then, but perhaps they ought to be
documented to make it easier for non-Unix ports such as yours to be aware
of them so they can be mapped into your naming space.

This is another artifact of Unix.  Most read loops look something like
this:

        while ((numbytes = read(fd,buffer,bytestoread)) > 0)
                do_something;

where fd is a filedescriptor, buffer is the buffer the data goes into,
and bytestoread is the number of bytes requests.  Read returns the
number of bytes read into numbytes.  With the exception of the last
(possibly partial) read of the file, numbytes should always equal
bytestoread.  The last read returns a partial buffer (everything from
the last read to end of file) and the number of bytes read in numbytes
(0 > numbytes >= bytestoread).  The program then makes a final read,
which, since they are now at EOF, returns a null buffer and numbytes is
0, quitting the loop.

What this means is that your choice of sending a 0 length stream is
correct. I hope the above clarifies things instead of making them worse.

That certainly clarifies "." and ".." and the read offset artifact.
It should definitely be documented that a SUN NFS client may
ask for "." and ".." in NFSPROC_LOOKUP. Handling of
out-of-range arguments in both READ and WRITE should also be
described.

It is very clever that the SUN NFS client caches files that
have been already read. I was suprised when I did
% cp foo/bar.lisp bar.lisp
for the first time. Saw it run, then decided to benchmark
my server by doing
% time cp foo/bar/lisp bar.lisp
I couldnt beleive how fast it was. Then I noticed that
only LOOKUP and GETATTR was being called on my server.

Suggestions for handling how to map filesystems with types
and version numbers, e.g. VMS, TOPS-20, all 3 Lispmachine companies,
would also be in order. I will write up the techniques that
we found useful along with suggestions.

In general this has been the most pleasent to implement set of
protocols I have ever done. And the only ones that I actually
could and did read the specs for completely, (and without looking
at any implementations). I have to admit that I never completely
read TELNET, FTP, etc.
