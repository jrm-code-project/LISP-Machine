An IRIS workstation may connect to an LMI-LAMBDA (having TCP-IP)
using either the "telnet" or "wsiris" commands.
Both of these commands connect to the TELNET server on the LMI-LAMBDA
which gives a lisp listener.

If you use "wsiris" then GL2 commands may be sent through the telnet
connection. example:

|#


(defun ltyo (&rest l)
  (let ((s (symeval-in-instance *terminal-io* 'tcp-application:output)))
    (dolist (c l)
      (send s :tyo c))))



;;Before sending any commands we must send the XGINIT:

(defun xginit ()
  (ltyo 16 51 33))

;;Then other commands may be sent, e.g. CLEAR:

(defun clear ()
  (ltyo 16 56 32))

(defun ringbell ()
  (ltyo 16 34 35))

;; The next thing to do:
;; modify "iris:iris;io" to have a switch so that *command-stream* will go
;; to the telnet connection and FORCE-OUTPUT-GRAPHICS-STREAM
;; will do a :string-out to *command-stream*.
