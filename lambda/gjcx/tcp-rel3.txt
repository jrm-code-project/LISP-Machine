 TCP-IP INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR RELEASE 3.0


(Step 1) Install Excelan Hardware
(Step 2) boot machine. it will say:

[WARNING: TCP network hardware available but no INTERNET address given]
[REQUEST: Please update site and machine configuration]

    Unless the user has customized his site files and saved his bands already
    and assigned INTERNET addresses, in which case it will say:

[WARNING: TCP network hardware download data not loaded. Not initializing]
[REQUEST: Please install TCP or call LMI software support]



At this point we can procedure with the TCP test installation.

(Step 3)

  Evaluate:

 (TCP:CRYPT-DOWNLOAD-DATA "some password" "some-code")


The pair "some-code" and "some password" go together, and are known by Dave Goodine.


(Step 4)  This is the usual tests to make sure hardware, including ethernet cables and transceivers
          are working correctly. The address "100.0.0.1" should be changed to whatever is proper
          at the particular site. And "100.0.0.2" to whatever other machine is on the site.

  (TCP:START :MY-INTERNET-ADDRESS "100.0.0.1")

  (TCP-APPLICATION:TELNET-GLASS-TTY "100.0.0.1" 'SMTP T)  ;; loop-back-test to our own mail server.
   QUIT

  (TCP-APPLICATION:TELNET-GLASS-TTY "100.0.0.2")  ;; connection to telnet server on some remote host.
  <ABORT>

(Step 5) Hardware is now checked out. Now on to site files. This is the same as in RELEASE 2.0

  Exception: If there are other LMI-LAMBDA's at a site, or some machine that provides
             a TIME server implementing the protocol documented in RFC-868
             via TCP-IP then these can be added to the site option:

                (:TIME-SERVER-HOSTS '("LAMBDA-A" "LAMBDA-B" "MACHINE-X"))

             So that (:STANDALONE NIL) is the proper thing in this case.
