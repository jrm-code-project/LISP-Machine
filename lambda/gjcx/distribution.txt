**  LMI STANDARD LAYERED-PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION **

 ** FORMAT **


1/2-INCH tape in standard LMFL format, can be made with COPY-DIRECTORY or other tape utilities.

The first file on the tape should be a character file of type "DISTRIBUTION"

A lisp form is read from the file using READ with
 *PACKAGE*   = TAPE
 *BASE*      = 10
 *READTABLE* = Common Lisp

The CAR of the form should be the symbol DISTRIBUTION-INSTALLATION-FORMS.


 ** PROCEDURE **

- The USER will be in the "LMI Tape Utility Frame" program (<SYSTEM>-B) and have physically mounted
  the specific layered-product medium in the tape drive.

- The command [INSTALL-DISTRIBUTION-TAPE] is invoked from the [RETREIVE] menu.

- A form is read from first file from the tape is describe above, and evaluated with EVAL.

- At this point the procedure is arbitrary, depending on the product. In most cases
  a menu will come up asking where and how to load files, what options to apply,
  etc.


 ** EXAMPLE **

 - TCP-IP in RELEASE 3.0

                                 :label "Choose TCP-IP installation parameters")
      (COND ((NOT *SOURCEP*)
