    STATUS REPORT ON TCP-IP IMPLEMENTATION FOR LMI-LAMBDA
    8/02/85 08:54:44 -George Carrette

The implementation uses a Multibus board, the Excelan Exos 201
Front-End Processor. This board is DMA, and has interrupt
generation capability, although that is not used at this time.
The device driver is straightforward and uses one process
to poll the device and handle reply messages, and in chaos mode
another process to handle incoming ethernet packets. In chaos
mode then there are 3 actively switching process, user, message,
and ethernet receiver when a file transfer is in process.

A file access method which uses the FTP protocal to connect to
a remote file system is sufficiently clever so as to support
the :TRUENAME :CREATION-DATE, :BYTE-SIZE, :LENGTH-IN-BYTES messages
that are expected by the system and user.

The distribution kit for release 2.0 consists of the TCP directory
plus all system patches up to July 31. Some of these patches are
required in order to gain access to new device specific slots in
the system configuration structure and to interface to ZMAIL,
the QFILE access mechanism and other parts of the system correctly.
The major skill required in installing the distribution kit is
the editing of site files to include INTERNET addresses and hosts.

Reading the file "SYS:SYS;EVAL.LISP" (LAM3's version) which is 131160
bytes long and requires about 282 chaos packets to be transmitted and
281 to be received. (Note: it would seem that due to the window size
we should not be transmitting so many packets). We test various
ways of receiving the file using both the chaosnet and tcp-ip protocols.

In TCP ASCII mode the FTP user is having to utilize
the equivalent of the VAX instruction MOVTC,
MOVE TRANSLATED UNTIL CHARACTER. A lispm->ASCII
translation (or Unix->ASCII) which is one-to-one
for all except the <NEWLINE> sequence must be
accomplished on both sides of the transfer,
hence the usefulness of MOVTC. It is doubtfull
that the VAX side actually uses this instruction
(given the implementation language "C"). The lispmachine
side doesnt have such an instruction to use at this
time. Notice the performance difference between
LISPM->LISPM transfers for the ASCII and BYTESIZE 8 (binary)
transfers. More than a factor of 3. Of course, when transfering
lispm->lispm the FTP-ACCESS method should be smart enough to
use BYTE 8 mode and forgo the translation. In this important
case then the TCP transfer is faster than the microcode assisted
chaosnet transfer LISPM->LISPM.

When in CHAOS MODE, each message coming from the excelan board
will contain only 488 bytes of data, the present limit for
chaosnet protocol imposed by the old chaosnet hardware.
When in TCP-IP mode, each message contains about 2000 bytes of
data, which is imposed by an arbitrarily chosen DMA buffer
size. Hence we see the process switch overhead when in
chaos mode but not in tcp mode. Extremely poor performance
talking to the UNIX 750 might be due to frames lost due to
no receive buffers. Gross amounts of packet retransmission,
possibly some problems on the Unix side also.

There is some work to be done in speeding up the process-wait's
used. Here is a test of process switching overhead:

(defvar *v1* nil)

(defun time-v0 (n &aux tm)
  (setq tm (time))
  (dotimes (j n)
    (setq *v1* (not *v1*)))

  `(,(quotient n tm) per second ,tm seconds total))

  (setq tm (quotient (time-difference (time) tm) 60.0))
  `(,(quotient n tm) per second ,tm seconds total))

(defvar *v2* nil)

(defun feed-v2 ()

   (process-wait "v1 ->" #'(lambda () *v1*))
   (let ((data *v1*))
     (setq *v1* nil)
     (process-wait "-> v2" #'(lambda () (not *v2*)))
     (setq *v2* data))))


(defun time-v2 (n &aux tm)
  (setq tm (time))
  (dotimes (j n)
    (process-wait "v2->" #'(lambda () *v2*))
    (setq *v2* nil))
  (setq tm (quotient (time-difference (time) tm) 60.0))
  `(,(quotient n tm) per second ,tm seconds total))

(defvar *v3* nil)

(defun feed-v3 ()
  (do-forever
   (process-wait "v1 ->" #'(lambda () *v1*))
   (let ((data *v1*))
     (setq *v1* nil)
     (process-wait "-> v3" #'(lambda () (not *v3*)))
     (setq *v3* data))))


(defun time-v3 (n &aux tm)
  (setq tm (time))
  (dotimes (j n)
    (process-wait "v3->" #'(lambda () *v3*))
    (setq *v3* nil))
  (setq tm (quotient (time-difference (time) tm) 60.0))
  `(,(quotient n tm) per second ,tm seconds total))


(defvar *a1* (make-array 1000 :type 'art-8b))
(defvar *a2* (make-array 1000 :type 'art-8b))

(defun time-copy (n &aux tm)
  (setq tm (time))
  (dotimes (j n)
    (copy-array-portion *a1* 0 (length *a1*) *a2* 0 (length *a2*)))
  (setq tm (quotient (time-difference (time) tm) 60.0))
  `(,(quotient n tm) per second ,tm seconds total))


(defun time-raw-copy (n &aux tm)
  (setq tm (time))
  (dotimes (j n)
    (%blt (%POINTER-PLUS
            (%POINTER *a1*)
            (SI:ARRAY-DATA-OFFSET *a1*))
          (%POINTER-PLUS
            (%POINTER *a2*)
            (SI:ARRAY-DATA-OFFSET *a2*))
          (floor (length *a1*) 4)
          1))
  (setq tm (quotient (time-difference (time) tm) 60.0))
  `(,(quotient n tm) per second ,tm seconds total))




We run these functions in different lisp listeners.
 TIME-V0 gets 35.9 thousand cycles per second.
 TIME-V1 gets 27.9 cycles per second.
 TIME-V2 gets 19.1 cycles per second.
 TIME-V3 gets 18.6 cycles per second.
 TIME-COPY at 114 cycles per second.
 TIME-RAW-COPY at 939 cycles per second.

The fact that we only see 12 packets per second out of
the excelan board is not too suprising. There is also
some extra copying going on using COPY-ARRAY-PORTION.
DMA-BUFFER => CHAOS-INT-PKT => CHAOS-PKT. The INT-PKT
step should be taken out, although it never was in the
case of the old LISP 3COM code.

The machine can do a straight copy of data at 114k bytes
per second using copy-array-portion and 0.94 megabytes
per second using %BLT.
