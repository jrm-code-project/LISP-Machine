Thoughts on beta test sites:

Format is SITE:, THEY-WANT-REASON:, WE-WANT-REASON:,  ABILITY-CONDITIONS:,
CONFLICTS:, PREVIOUS-EXPERIENCE:


SITE: LMI PICON GROUP.
THEY-WANT-REASON: GC will be of benefit to their in-production system.
WE-WANT-REASON: Good test.
COMMUNICATION: LOCAL, on-site LMI consultant, mail and file transfer via chaosnet.
ABILITY-CONDITIONS: Experienced and well organized group.
CONFLICTS: * Must have constomer support coordinate ECO to SDU software.
PREVIOUS-EXPERIENCE: Good. They need a software ECO procedure though,
because in the past they (i.e. their customers) could have benefited
by fixes to the uCODE and LISP that they were not able to encorporate
due to a lack of corporate direction on this issue.

SITE: CMD
THEY-WANT-REASON: Again, a GC is very good to have in a continous production system.
WE-WANT-REASON: A moderately large system that uses networking, window system,
and shared memory/streams.
COMMUNICATION: CAMBRIDGE local. on-site consulting easy. mail via local telephone.
file transfer via handcary tape.
ABILITY-CONDITIONS: Good.
CONFLICTS: They must use version 7 Unix kernel linked by Technology Concepts Inc.
for DECNET.
PREVIOUS-EXPERIENCE: Their last port, release 1 to release 2 resulted in a speed
up of a factor of two. GJC's portaid package made the otherwise excruciating
DEFSYSTEM problems that would have come up into a turn-key recompilation.
They will be enthusiastic.

SITE: MCC.
THEY-WANT-REASON: Modernizations of networking software that will make TCP
usage more general. Different subsites:
 1. HUMAN INTERFACE: Better code for writing device drivers is a win.
 2. CAD: They are shipping results to other sites now, so they should be
    given sufficient "lead-time" on our full release schedule data.
 3. Parallel Processing: Built-in LAMBDA-DIAG and Microcode Assembler
    will help their effort towards hacking lisp low-levels considerably.
WE-WANT-REASON: *****
COMMUNICATION: on site consultant. mail and file transfer via ARPANET.
ABILITY-CONDITIONS: good.
CONFLICTS: Unknown.
PREVIOUS-EXPERIENCE: yes. They could make use of PORTAIDs this time.


SITE: Los Alamos, JIM O'DELL.
THEY-WANT-REASON: Serious Macsyma work requires the GC.
WE-WANT-REASON:   DOE-Macsyma is a good test. And they need lead time on new distribution.
ABILITY-CONDTIONS: expert.
COMMUNICATION: mail and file transfer via ARPANET.
CONFLICTS: none.
PREVIOUS-EXPERIENCE: none.

SITE: MITRE, WASH DC.
THEY-WANT-REASON: the GC will allow them to finally be able to run their system for
longer than 5 (simulated) minutes.
WE-WANT-REASON: maybe too late to save this as an dedicated LMI customer, but we can try.
COMMUNICATION: no machine->machine possible. (VAULT) This may be a very good start
for our new washingon dc area tech rep.
ABILITY-CONDITIONS: depends on personel assigned.
PREVIOUS-EXPERIENCE: Good, need portaids.
CONFLICTS: system might not be ready to port at the time. personel to port may
not be available. however, 1->2 was a bigger jump than 2->3.


SITE: SILICART
THE-WANT-REASON: The GC will allow them to design bigger chips.
WE-WANT-REASON: large system is good testing ground.
ABILITY-CONDITIONS: good.
COMMUNICATION: we could set up a UUCP between their UNIX VAX and our UNIX VAX.
PREVIOUS-EXPERIENCE: yes.
CONFLICTS: unknown.


SITE: THINKING MACHINES.
THEY-WANT-REASON: see if LMI can do anything decent.
WE-WANT-REASON: see if we can give them anything they think is decent software.
Stark comparision here between Symbolics and LMI.
ABILITY-CONDITIONS: good. Need landscape monitors to make it fly or else they
wont be able to run their simulator software (which requires large screen area)
PREVIOUS-EXPERIENCE: not much usage.
COMMUNICATION: mail and file transfer via arpanet.
CONFLICTS: unknown.

SITE: BRL
THEY-WANT-REASON: not determined.
WE-WANT-REASON: machine is first LMI-LAMBDA listed as ARPANET host. test network software
under real live arpanet conditions.
COMMUNICATION: mail and file transfer via arpanet.
ABILITY-CONDITIONS: good.
PREVIOUS-EXPERIENCE: no.
CONFLICTS: probably not since they have just started using the machine.


Network Software Status:

New function NETWORK:NETWORK-PATH-AVAILABLE and NETWORK:DEFINE-NETWORK-FUNCTION.
Purpose: keying off NETWORK:*NETWORK-PROTOCOLS* = (:CHAOS :INTERNET)
  :CHAOS is only protocol available then non-chaos protocols wont get used.
  :INTERNET is only protocol available (e.g. when only an EXCELAN board)
  then :CHAOS protocols wont get used.
Hooked into:
* DEFINE-FILE-ACCESS, so that TCP-only sites such as MCC Human Interface
  wont need 'custom' site file kludge as set up by Jim Mynett.
* DECODE-UNIT-ARGUMENT, so that PRINT-DISK-LABEL and COPY-DISK-PARTITION
  will work invariant across protocols.
Need to hack:
 - HOSTAT this will be chaos only, FIXED. WONT TRY NON-CHAOS HOSTS.
 - FINGER/NAME, USER END FIXED. :INTERNET SERVER implimented, patched into system.
 - QSEND/CONVERSE USER END FIXED. QSEND :INTERNET USER implemented. Server also, but
   doesnt handle SI:*other-processors* yet.
 - TELNET/SUPDUP very chaos specific, weird hostname parsing, so punted on this.

DONT NEED TO HACK:
 - MAIL. There is already a site-file-specified MAIL SERVER HOST and MAIL METHOD.
   So the system manager (site-configuration-manager) can specify the right thing
   to do for his site.
 - HARDCOPY. again is already specified by site-configuration-manager.


The duplication of functionality and interface in SUPDUP/TELNET, SYSTEM-U (Unix)
and KERMIT are as yet unresolved. NEED: A terminal emulator program (SYSTEM-T)
that has selectable MODES that can take the place off all of these.
The KERMIT interface handles all of these functions except SUPDUP, and subdup would
be just another terminal mode, such as ANSI and VT-100 if it were generalized as
such.
 * STRONGLY SUGGEST. That an able person in the USER-INTERFACE group be given
   as a task to complete during the beta-test period (1 month is well enough
   for a good person to do this) a universal terminal interface program
   that subsumes all the functionality of our present ad-hoc interfaces.


TCP-KERNEL optimization:
 * tcp works by user processes sending messages to the network-front-end-processor,
   and receving replies. It is an interprocessor function call mechanism with
   call-by-reference (for dma buffer arrays). Because both the lispmachine and the
   front-end-board are running realtime multiprocessing operating systems each lispm
   process must process-wait on the reply status from the board. The demultiplexing
   of replies from the board is handled in general by a background process in the
   lispmachine.
  ** The optimization: To busy loop (a few milliseconds worth) in the user process
     before going to the full process-wait.
  Example benchmark:
  MACHINE: VAX 11/750
  OPERATING: VMS 4.2
  TCP: EXCELAN EXOS
  FILE: LISP.EXE
     Busy Loops   KBytes/Sec      Handle Own     Estimated overhead, milliseconds
       NIL         47.5             0%
       10          47.5             5%                  2
       50          38.9            10%                  8
       60          61.2            72%                 10
       75          68.6            92%                 12
      100          77.2            99%                 16
      200          77.2            99%                 32

  *** Explaination:
      Performance goes down at N = 50 because the hit ratio is only 5% and yet we are expending
      time in the busy loop.
  *** We chose a busy loop count of 100, the overhead of 16 milliseconds is also the minimum
      value which TV:CLOCK-RATE may take.
