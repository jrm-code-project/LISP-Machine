  SUBJECT: Some RPG benchmark summaries and comparisons.

Here are some tables comparing such things as lambda with and without
the cache and microcompilation, 3600 with and without the IFU, and an
"improvement due to software" comparison, that of a lambda running the
release 1.2 software vs one running the latest beta-test with
microcompilation utilized.  You may recall the figures of lambda at 3-3
vs 2-2 vs 1-1 that I showed at the last planning meeting at Steve's
house... now that the various statistics counters are working we could do
some more experiments to allow us to dispense with so many tables of figures
as these and replace this knowlege with a few choice formuli giving the
performance of the lambda with various features utilized and not
utilized at various levels of capability. This would allow extremely
accurate prediction of performance changes over evolutionary (or incremental)
changes in the architecture.

Nomenclature: S<number>-U<number>-<month><day> is an lmi-lambda figure.
If -U is tagged to the name then it means "microcompilation" and if a -C
then cache. There is a fluke in the timing for BOYER and TAK. These are
zero because of clock problems.  (the machine i was using did not have a
working microsecond clock).

One might think that there may be some problem of interpretation of the
TIME for the FPRINT and FREAD benchmarks. Note that we measure ourselves
as 5.6 times slower on FPRINT and 3.45 times slower on FREAD. Perhaps
the Symbolics timings also do not include network latency. (The
benchmark as given by RPG has a timer around everything, opening the
file, doing the I/O, and closing it). The reported lambda timings here
are for remote file access, I do not know under what conditions the
Symbolics timings were run.

                 LAMBDA                       3600
           REMOTE-FILE     LOCAL-FILE         reported
FPRINT        14.65           6.36              2.6
FREAD         15.86          14.8               4.6

So it seems that maybe in FPRINT there are some significant latency
considerations, but even with a timing of 6.36 and 14.8 it is obvious
that what our users have been telling us is true, "file access on the
lambda is *!%%$#% slow compared with what people are used to on the
3600." A factor of 3 or 4 in an area like this is extremely visible.  On
the other hand, one could make strong arguments that file access isnt
one of the more important areas for an large-address-space interactive
debugging environment like the lispmachine. However, the file access
time here is also strongly related to the general speed of message
passing constructs on which the I/O system is built.

I did provide MCC with some utilities for implementing a disk-based
database system which bypassed all filesystem overhead, but which can
still be used at "applications-programmer" level in terms of ease of
support.  As is typical for the crew at Symbolics, the user would need
to go to a great deal more effort (in terms of initial implementation
understanding and complexity and maintainence effort due to operating
system changes over time) to get the same level of simple disk
functionality from a 3600, although some day the long rumored "Symbolics
winning new database system, solves all problems of computer science
..." may emerge.

The first table is LAMBDA-BEST and 3600-BEST, this should get the widest
possible distribution. I have gotten reports from potential customers
(that is people who are "looking" and "asking" about the machines) that
symbolics has even recently been giving people papers showing the lambda
figures from August 1984 vs the published 3600 figures; claiming that
they represent "the figures from Richard Gabriel at Standford." We
should probably suggest to Standford University that they may loose some
of the credibility that Symbolics is trying to take advange of here
through their misrepresentations.

The second table is how we would look without the cache and without
microcompilation.  The results speaks for itself.
