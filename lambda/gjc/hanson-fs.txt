Chris Hanson:  An Environment-like "File" System for Scheme

This paper describes the design of a "file" system which can be used
to store arbitrary Scheme objects.  The system stores the objects in
"directories", which appear to the Scheme user to be ordinary
environments.  The same primitive procedures, e.g. LEXICAL-ASSIGNMENT
and ACCESS, can be used on these environments as on any other.

The difference is that the environments, and the objects which they
contain, normally are stored on disk.  Binding a name in such an
environment to an object will normally cause that object to be removed
from the heap, and stored on the disk.  Referring to an object stored
on disk, using ACCESS for example, causes the object to be moved from
the disk to the heap.  Using a mechanism similar to FASDUMP, all RAM
references to an existing object will be kept up to date when it is
moved to or from disk.  A different mechanism, which will be
described, is used to maintain references from disk to disk, and from
disk to RAM.

The environment system requires, from the host operating system, some
means of allocating and deallocating disk blocks.  It also requires
the ability to read and write entire blocks in a random access
fashion.  Contiguity of the blocks is not required, and the size of
the disk block is relatively unimportant.  Ideally the system would
have direct access to the disk driver, and would operate on an area of
the disk that the host system was not using for other purposes.

It is quite feasible to build the system on top of an existing file
system, however.  This can be accomplished by creating random access
files in multiples of the block size, using names that Scheme can
easily generate and maintain internally.  The files would then be
opened an closed as required by the environment system's need to read
or write blocks in any particular file.

                            Block Headers

>From the environment system's point of view, each block will consist
of a fixed number of 32 bit words.  Each will have a unique block
number, which is a 32 bit unsigned integer.  For a typical block size
of 1024 bytes, this gives an addressing range of 16 terabytes, which
seems more than adequate given the hardware currently available to us.

Each block will have a header of about 8 words.  The first four words
are the same for every block, as follows:

                +-------+-------+-------+-------+
                | type  |       (reserved)      | 0
                +-------+-------+-------+-------+
                |         backward link         | 1
                +-------+-------+-------+-------+
                |          forward link         | 2
                +-------+-------+-------+-------+
                |           (reserved)          | 3
                +-------+-------+-------+-------+

The next four words are type-dependent, but reserved for all types.
The remaining words hold type-dependent data.

The TYPE field is mostly for use by a salvager, to determine what each
block is for after the system has suffered some damage.  Initially all
blocks have type FREE, meaning they are available for allocation, and
they are doubly linked together using the FORWARD/BACKWARD-LINK
fields.

Normally, the links are used to join together a group of blocks that
represent a single logical entity.  An alternate mechanism which has
different advantages would be to use maps which indicate where all of
the blocks for that entity are stored.  This would be fairly easy to
implement also, and maybe should be used instead if it is found that
more rapid access to the middle of a large entity is needed.

                       Objects and Environments

The most important block type is OBJECT, which is what Scheme objects
will become when they are stored in the system.  Another important
type is ENVIRONMENT; ENVIRONMENT blocks have the same properties as
ordinary OBJECT blocks, but they are treated differently in some
cases.  The second four words in an OBJECT block are the following:

                +-------+-------+-------+-------+
                |           superiors           | 4
                +-------+-------+-------+-------+
                |       outward pointers        | 5
                +-------+-------+-------+-------+
                |        inward pointers        | 6
                +-------+-------+-------+-------+
                |           (reserved)          | 7
                +-------+-------+-------+-------+

The SUPERIORS slot points to a list which is used to keep track of
what ENVIRONMENT blocks this object appears in.  The elements of the
list are pairs, each of which contains a pointer to an ENVIRONMENT
block, and a pointer to a name, which is the name to which the object
is bound in that environment.

Conversely, the ENVIRONMENT block is organized as a sequence of
name/object pairs, probably sorted to improve search time.  The
redundant information is, again, maintained to help make the system
crash proof, and aid in salvaging.

The OUTWARD-POINTERS and INWARD-POINTERS lists are used to keep track
of references between objects stored in the system.  Initially, stored
objects have no references in either direction.  But when an object is
stored that contains pointers to previously-stored objects, a list of
those pointers is put in OUTWARD-POINTERS.  Conversely, each of those
objects gets the newly-stored object added to its INWARD-POINTERS
list.

Then, when an object is moved from disk to RAM, if anything points at
it from disk, a forwarding pointer can be left, pointing to a table in
RAM, which contains the object's actual heap pointer.  This prevents
the object from being garbage-collected, and can be used to update the
disk pointers when the object is eventually returned to the disk.

Admittedly, this is a complicated mechanism, but I don't see any
alternative if we want to have the flexibility it provides.

                           Names and Lists

The somewhat offhand references to names and lists above ignored the
issue of how such things would be represented in the system.  Since
these things are referred to in very fixed ways, there is some
flexibility in their implementation.  The key idea here is that a
pointer to a name or a list can never be confused with a pointer to a
block.

I envision that there would be blocks allocated specifically to hold
entities of a particular type, and pointers to such objects would, say,
have their top 24 bits be a block number, and their bottom 8 bits be
an offset into that block.  The block number would be an ordinary
block number, since it seems that there would not be very much need
for this kind of block.  Other types of blocks could be numbered above
this since there is no constraint on block numbering.

Names would be interned, pretty much as they are in Scheme, since they
are supposed to correspond to Scheme symbols anyway.  Deallocation of
names would be a difficult process, requiring a full GC of the
environment system, but that should not be a serious problem given
that interning tends to keep things around for a long time anyway.
And likely there would not be an awful lot of names.

Lists of various kinds could be allocated and deallocated easily,
since they are all of a uniform size.  Since the deallocation is
completely under the control of the environment system, no garbage
collection would be required.  It might be desirable to segregate the
lists based on what they are used for, again to aid in salvaging.
