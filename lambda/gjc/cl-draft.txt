Subject: lisp listings

I'll send this directly to the whole mailing list to give
people a chance to point out anything I've left out.
Here are two listings:

(1) MIT-LISPMACHINE SYSTEM, or MIT-ZETALISP, MIT-SYSTEM 99
(2) implemented at MIT AI LAB
(3) MIT-CADR, LMI-CADR, SYMBOLICS-LM2
(4) now
(5) full
(6) in fact a couple numerical functions such as complex ACOS seem to be missing.
(7) no commercial support.
(8) Systemic: Flavors, ZMACS editor, chaosnet protocols on chaos or ethernet hardware.
    File-System.
    Applications: check through the AI LAB memos.

(1) ZETALISP-PLUS(tm)
(2) Lisp Machine Inc.
(3) LMI-LAMBDA(tm), LMI-LAMBDA-E(tm), TI-EXPLORER(tm).
(4) now.
(5) full.
(7) Lisp Machine Inc
    6 Tech Drive
    Andover MA 01810
    671-689-3554, or 1-800-USA-LISP for customer service.
(8)  Systemic: Flavors, ZMACS editor, chaosnet and tcp-ip protocols on ethernet hardware.
     File-System. ObjectLisp(tm) alternative object oriented programming system.
     Applications:
     PICON(tm) Industrial Process Control System.
     DOE-MACSYMA, symbolic algebra system.
     VISTA(tm) 3-D generic graphics system and window-system extensions
     implemented in ObjectLisp(tm).
     KEE(tm), ART(tm).


The applications are of course mainly in the Zetalisp we all know and
loved, so even though one could come up with an impressively long list
of lispmachine software applications that could be misleading, in that
that not all those applications were in fact in "Common-Lisp." The
ObjectLisp(tm) package is the closest (Objectlisp(tm) uses LOOP at this time)
to being common lisp, running on the Symbolics, LMI, and MIT VAX-NIL
implementations.
