   SUBJECT: LMI USERS and the Multibus. Request for Comment.

   Here is a rought draft of some new and old material relating to the
   use of the multibus by LMI users. There are four examples given,
   1. a simple board that has I/O registers and does DMA.
      This would be like a disk or tape controller or some array processors.
      Or an ICON board (DR11-W emulator).
   2. an array-processor that looks like multibus memory.
      The example includes data conversion issues.
   3. the emulex SCSI bus adaptor. This uses I/O registers, DMA, and interrupts.
   4. the CD3508 communications board. This uses I/O registers, multibus memory,
      DMA, and interrupts.

  For Knick I've included some interesting material on IBM interfacing he
  requested. Yet another useful looking multibus board.
