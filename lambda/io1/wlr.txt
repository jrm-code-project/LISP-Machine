      (ED) <FORM>
      <MOUSE3> TWICE, MENU SELECTION "SELECT"

      ... SCREEN DIVIDED INTO 2 SECTIONS.  TOP SECTION DISPLAYS

CALIBRATION OF PRONGS

      (CTEST-CALIBRATE)

      ... MOVE PROBES TO LOCAL 1A1-10 (LEFT PROBE,  THEN RIGHT PROBE).
          TO MOVE PROBES,  USE [ ] \ /  FOR DIRECTION AND
          <TOP> <SHIFT> <META> <CNTRL> FOR MAGNITUDE.

          AFTER PROBE IS OVER 1A10-10,  USE <MOUSE1> TO DOWN/UP PROBE.

          INVOKE <MOUSE2> FOR ELECTRCAL CENTERING.  IF PROBE IS NOT
          MAKING CONTACT WITH PIN,  NOTHING OCCURS,  SO MOVE PROBE
          AND TRY AGAIN.

          THEN,  INVOKE <MOUSE3> FOR MECHANICAL CENTERING.
          END CENTERING ROUTINE WITH <RUB>.  THIS POPS THE CENTERING
          ROUTINE OFF THE STACK.

      ... DEFAULT QUSTN 1 WITH <N>.

          THE RESPONSE TO QUESTN 2  -# OF BOARDS-  SHOULD BE FOLLOWED
          BY <SPACE>.  (INPUT IS AN ATOM)

      ... <SPACE> ALSO DEFAULTS TO YES.

      ... "MORE" QUESTNS SHOULD BE ANSWERED WITH <SPACE>.

      ... AFTER CALIBRATN,  TYPE <RUB> TO POP CALIBTATN ROUTINE
          OFF STACK.


PROCESS ROUTINE


      (CTEST-PROCESS-WLR "<FILENAME>" 0 <OP> )

              FOR 2 BOARDS ---  <FILENAME> IS  CADRWD;ICMEM3 WLR
                                <OP>       IS  T    (ALREADY LOADED)

              FOR 4 BOARDS ---  <FILENAME> IS  CADRWD;CADR4 WLR
                                <OP>       IS  NIL

      ... ROUTINE TAKES SOME TIME IN BEGINNG TO READ-IN DATA AND SORT.
