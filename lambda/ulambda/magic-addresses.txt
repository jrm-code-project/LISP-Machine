Lambda IO devices:
  Hardware wise, things are simplified by the slot-space concept, in conjunction
with the 32 bit (of bytes) physical address space.  However, now we have the
problem that we dont have enuf virtual address space to simply map in all the
physical address space.  From a practical point of view, the main things
we are interested in mapping are the multibus address space, and the multibus
IO registers.  These are both physically contained in the slot address space of
the SDU card.  (See the TI/Irvine blurb for a complete listing of SDU addresses)

  The multibus address space is a 20 bit byte address, while the IO space
is a 18 bit byte address.  However, much less that this is normally used.

Interm Lambda (24 bit) virtual address mapping:
 ** we are now in 25 bit mode.  Put a one in front of all these addresses **
  In the CADR, XBUS I/O space occupied 77000000 to 77377777 and the unibus
was mapped to 77400000 to 77777777.  So a total of 18 bits of 32 bit words
worth of virtual address space is available for "redeployment".

Usage of MULTI-NUBUS mapping registers:
**old stuff.  It gets this from the SYS-CONF structure now.  **
  Microcode disk routines in ULAMBDA use mapping registers starting at 577
   21 registers can be used.
  also uses 576 for share-iopb structure
  The prom bootstram uses mapping register:
        570 for DATA
        571 for IOPB
        576 for share-iopb structure

  The SDU uses some...

  The console program uses 477 and on..

  Magtape code uses 540 and on.

Disk configuration info
The CMOS ram contains a complicated structure, but here is what is interesting:

  Multibus location (low 8 bits used)

   360140  #/d
   360144  #/i
   360150  #/s
   360154  #/k

   360210  number of heads
   360214  number of sectors/track

If we want, we can check for the "disk" string, for insurance against changes.
But in any case the other two locations will work for as long as we use the
same setup tapes, maybe longer.

This file is supposed to document Unibus addresses used in the Lisp machine.
    Also see section on Xbus addresses after Unibus.
    First, we have a textual description of the more important things.

The unibus and xbus can be referred to through the virtual memory of the
Lisp machine.  When this is done, the unibus runs from address 77400000
to address 777777777.  The xbus i/o space runs from 770000000 to 773777777.
The xbus i/o space contains 32-bit words just like Lisp machine memory.
The unibus is made of 16-bit words, and each word is stored in the least
significant bits of one Lisp machine word.  So, to convert a unibus
address to a Lisp machine virtual address, you must divide by two (bytes
to words) and then add 774000000.  Normally programs access the unibus with
the functions %UNIBUS-READ and %UNIBUS-WRITE, so they don't need to contain
these numbers.

The unibus map

When unibus devices do direct memory access to Lisp machine memory, they
do so through a special facility in the bus interface which allows some
parts of the Lisp machine main memory to appear on the unibus.  Any 16.
pages of main memory can be selected to appear in 16. slots, which take
up the range from 140000 to 177777 in unibus addresses.  Each Lisp
machine memory word is accessed as two unibus words; the low half has
the lower unibus address.  The unibus device should always access both
unibus words, low word first, in order for the hardware to work.  This
is because the bus interface actually stores half of the xbus word and
usually accesses the main memory only once for each pair of unibus
operations.  A special mode called write through mode exists in which
each unibus write operation will actually write the xbus location.  This
only applies to the second half of the mapped unibus pages, and is
turned on by bit 7 (200) in the bus interface's Error Status register.

To select the xbus pages to map into the unibus address space, you use the
sixteen map registers which exist in the unibus at 766140 through 766176.
Each register is one unibus word.  Bit 15 of the register signifies that
mapping of that page is turned on; otherwise, that section of the unibus
is non-existent memory.  Bit 14 enables write access from the unibus.
The remainder of the register is the page number (address divided by 400)
of the xbus page to be accessed from this unibus page.

The 16-bit parallel I/O register.

The I/O board contains one 16-bit register which can be connected to an
arbitrary device.  Any unibus word written to this register appears on one
set of connector pins; reading from this register samples another set of
connector pins.  The register unibus address is 764126.

To attach a 16-bit input device, use connector J07 on the I/O board.
Pins 1 through 16 on this connector connect to the input bits.
(Pins 17 through 20 connect to output bits 0 through 3).
Similarly, connector J08 contains all the output bits and the low four
input bits, in the same arrangement.  Use this for a 16-bit output device.

Connector J05 contains input bits 0 through 9 and output bits 0 through 9,
in connector pins 1 through 10 and 11 through 20.  This is good for a single
bidirectional device.

If you connect to two of these connectors, all connections to the same input
or output pin are shorted together.

Serial I/O.

The serial I/O port uses unibus locations from 764160 through 164166.
It interrupts with vector 264.  More information needs to be inserted here.

Timers.

The I/O board contains three timers: the microsecond clock, the 60 cycle clock,
and the interval timer.  The first two are registers that you can read.  The
last functions by generating interrupts.  (The 60 cycle clock can also
be enabled to interrupt).

The microsecond clock is incremented every microsecond.  It is a 32-bit register
which is accessed as two unibus locations, at addresses 764120 and 764122.
The low address is the low half of the register.  This half must be accessed
first if you want to get two halfwords that are compatible with each other
(no carries appear to have happened between one reference and the other).
This clock is used for the function TIME, and for updating the who line.

The 60 cycle clock is under the control of the AC power.  It has 16 bits,
and appears at unibus address 764124.  You must read the clock repeatedly
until two references get the same value; otherwise you may have referred to
it while a carry was propagating and get an incorrect value.  The Lisp machine
system does not use this clock.

Ths interval timer can be used to generate an interrupt after a specified
amount of time, in units of 16 microseconds.  The timer register is write-only
and located at unibus address 764124 (the same address which, when read, gives
the 60 cycle clock).  The timer increments each 16 microseconds, and when it
reaches zero, it requests an interrupt with a vector of 274.

Keyboard.

Data from the keyboard appears in a 32-bit register at unibus addresses
764100 and 764102.  The high half must be read first.  The keyboard generates
an interrupt with vector number 260 when data is available, if enabled
(see the I/O board status register).

Connector J03 on the I/O board runs to the console, carrying the keyboard,
mouse and speaker signals as well as the video output signal that runs through
the I/O board from the TV board.

Mouse.

The mouse X position, in 16 bits, is accessible at unibus address
764106, and the Y position and buttons are in 764104.  Only the
difference between two X-positions or Y-positions is meaningful.
Changes in the mouse position or buttons can cause an interrupt, but the
Lisp machine system does not enable the interrupt.  If enabled, the
interrupt vector is 260.

Speaker.

To complement the signal sent to the keyboard speaker, refer to unibus
location 764110.  The value is meaningless.  A sound is produced by
complementing the signal at the desired frequency.

I/O board status register.

Unibus address 764112 contains the I/O board status register.
In this register:
 Bit 0  enables the remote mouse (?)
 Bit 1  enables interrupts on change of mouse status.
 Bit 2  enables interrupts from the keyboard.
 Bit 3  enables clock interrupts.
 Bit 7  enables input interrupts from the serial I/O port.

Chaos Interface.

The I/O board contains the interface to the Chaos network.

The chaosnet interface registers appear at addresses 764140 through
764152 on the unibus, and it interrupts with vector 270.  For
programming information, see the AI lab memo on the Chaosnet.

The interface contains two DIP switches which control the network
address of the interface.  The address is a 16 bit number whose high 8
bits are the subnet number.  DIP D10 sets the subnet number and DIP D12
sets the low 8 bits of the address.  A switch which is "ON" signifies
a zero in the network address!  If a ten-switch DIP is used, only the
middle 8 switches are meaningful.  The switches are numbered from least
significant bit upward.

The machine can read its own network address from unibus address 764142.
This is the only way that the Lisp machine operating system knows which
Lisp machine it is running on: it reads the machine's network address
and looks that up in the host table.

Not all chaosnet subnets correspond to physical cables, but each physical
cable is one subnet, and has a unique subnet number.  All the net interfaces
connected to the cable must have that subnet number in their net addresses.

Connector J01 on the I/O board runs to the transceiver box.

02      RW      Clock duration - Delay 2
03      RW      Clock duration - Phase 1
04      RW      Write: Map address (for examine/deposit)
                Read: Memory address chip last referenced
05      RW      Map data (addressed by Map Address register)

                1       RW      Run (turns on/off clock, clock registers should not
                                     be changed with run on)
                2       RW      External freeze (freezes chip, does not stop clock)

                4       R       NXM (cleared by reset or mem start)
                5       R       Parity error (cleared by reset or mem start)
                6       R       Invalid map location addressed (cleared by reset or mem start)
                7       RW      Freeze on error (causes chip to be frozen when one of
                                                  above conditions is true)
                8       RW      Freeze on GC (freeze when GC interrupt is set)

                                Write: Mem restart (writing a 1 restarts the Scheme chip
                                after a failing memory cycle.  LISPM should have
                                looked at the write data for a write, or stored
                                the read data for a read)
                15      R       State hacking (reading or writing) in progress
                16      R       Chip read signal (chip is waiting for a memory cycle)

07      RW      Single Step (single steps chip up to 256 times, only useful when Force Freeze
                             is set and RUN is on)
                Reading reads the current state of the counter.  Useful if froze due to
                memory cycle
10      RW      Reading reads latched state, writing causes state to be latched at
                next convenient time
11      RW      Int Vector
12      RW      GC vector (vector sent to chip for GC interrupt)
13       W      Loads new state into chip
14      RW      Memory data
15       W      Clears external interrupt request, data is ignored
16       W      Writing causes an external interrupt
