We have discovered a fundamental bug in the implementation of lexical
variables in our system.  Nothing short of a radical change can repair
the bug.  Therefore, we present the following plan.  It may seem
convoluted in places, but it is careful to make each change fairly
compatable with the preceeding one.  If any step is radically
incompatable, and you make a mistake, you will be faced with compiling
the system serveral times, plus addressing the issue of making the
system support two versions of the compiler at the same time.

1.  Move Rest args to the heap.

Currently, when a function with a rest arg is about to be entered, the
address of the rest arg is computed and stored into LOCAL|0.  Change
this to copy the Q's between the end of the required and optional
arguments into the heap, and then store a pointer to the new block in
LOCAL|0.  There are some subtle issues when the caller has supplied
more arguments than there are required and optional arguments, but it is
not too bad.  APPLY will require special handling.

Finally, put the local block at the end of the args.

2.  Write a QFASL filter to change LOC references to ARG references.
Something like this was done in system 95 to change the destination
codes, and the code is probably still around.  If there are N arguments,
then LOC|M goes to ARG|N+M.  Look for instructions, like
make-stack-closure that name local slots by number, and translate them
too.  At this point, the system can still run both old FEF's and new
translated FEF's.  Use the debugging-info to identify translated fefs.

Update the error handler to work on both old and new fefs.

3.  Remove references to the argument base LOC from the compiler,
replacing them with the appropriate ARG base, and put a property on the
file-property-list that disables the above written translator.  Don't
forget to keep the extra local slots for stack-closure stuff.  Patch the
old system to refuse to load these new QFASLs.

4.  Build a new cold load using the translator.  Now the world has no
references to the LOC macroinstruction offset.

5.  Decommit A-LOCALP.

Remove from UC-LAMBDA-MACROCODE all of the macroinstructions that use
the LOC base.

Change the way STACK-CLOSURES are created to use the end of the argument
block instead of the local block.

Change any other references to the variable A-LOCALP.

6.  Create a new macroinstruction argument base called ARG-TRANSPORT
replacing the macroinstructions for LOC.  These instructions are the
same as ARG, but are willing to follow forwarding pointers from the stack.

7.  Change the compiler to make any code that references variables that
are lexically closed over do so by using ARG-TRANSPORT.

8.  The big step:

Change %make-stack-closure in the microcode to create a vector in the
heap for the closed variables.  Copy the current values from the stack,
and leave behind EXTERNAL-VALUE-CELL-POINTERs.  Then return a
DTP-CLOSURE.  Change the unshare stuff to work with the new structures.
Notice that there is nothing left to copy out of the frame when
returning.  Therefore, remove all code associated with that, namely,
%%LP-ENS-ENVIRONMENT-POINTER-POINTS-HERE.

Also notice that no DTP-STACK-CLOSUREs can exist in a world booted with
this new microcode.  All processes are reset by booting, and no stack
closures can exist in memory.  Therefore, decommit DTP-STACK-CLOSURE at
this time.

9.  Now that the stack no longer contains any closure information,
change the compiler so that it doesn't allocate space for stack-closures
themselves, stack-closure-vectors, or the random words at the end that
are no longer needed.

10.  Finally, after everything works, recompile again.
