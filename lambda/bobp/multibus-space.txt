Multibus address space
8/5/86

Multibus I/O Space:

I/O space is considered to be an 8-bit space for purposes of allocation,
but this is probably not necessary.  The current devices decode 12 or 16
bits, so it should be possible to use more than the first 256 locations.

Customers may use I/O ports 0xc0 .. 0xff.  LMI will attempt to keep these
free in future releases.

Multibus I/O space:
        0x2000..0x3f00  TITN
        0x40 .. 0x43    smd 2181
        0x60 .. 0x63    tapemaster
        0x80 .. 0x87    mti (systech serial mux)
        0xa0 .. 0xa7    excelan ethernet

Multibus Memory Space:

The system uses a 20-bit Multibus address space.  The devices listed in
the table are the only fixed addresses at present.  Multibus devices and
SDU programs that do DMA access to the NuBus must have additional
multibus space to use for the transactions that are mapped to the NuBus.

20-bit Multibus memory space:
        0x0-ffff        0 .. 63k        SDU RAM
        0x18000-18fff   96 .. 99k       SDU multibus => nubus map control registers
        0x1c000         112k            SDU registers (serial ports etc.)
        0x1e000-1ffff   120 .. 127k     SDU cmos ram
        x20000-23fff    128 .. 143k     Reliance serial I/O
        x2f8000         190k            Burr-brown debug master (second)
        x2fc000         191k            Burr-brown debug master (first)
        x30000-31fff    192 .. 199k     3com ethernet
        x38000-3ffff    224 .. 255k     CDC serial I/O
        x40000-xeffff   256 .. 960k     Dynamically allocated area
        xf0000-xfffff   960 .. 1023k    SDU ROM

The "dynamically allocated area" is the resource for the Boot software
and for the DMA transfers for normal operation of all the processors.
Space in this area is allocated from the bottom up; whatever is left is
available for user-defined Multibus operations and is allocated from the
top down.  This ensures that the user-defined area is at a fixed
location (the top end, at least) independent of the amount of the
available space.

To compute the available space, subtract the appropriate numbers shown
below from 700k.

Space required for all configurations:
        100k    SDU Boot (Newboot)
        140k    LAMBDA (each)
        70k     System V UNIX (each)
        50k     2.0 V7 UNIX (each)

Space taken by optional DMA devices:
        70k     Tapemaster 1/2" tape
        30k     Excelan Ethernet (each)
        4k      MTI serial I/O (each)
        ??      CDC serial I/O
        ??      Reliance serial I/O

For example, the following table shows the available space for some
configurations, not including any optional DMA devices.

Space available, not including optional DMA devices:
        460k    LAMBDA
        390k    LAMBDA-Plus (System V)
        320k    LAMBDA 2x2
        250k    2x2-Plus (System V)
        184k    LAMBDA 3x3

The "available space" may be reserved by the using the SDU Config
program "system maps" command.  Config warns if the reserved space is
close to the limit.  If too much space is reserved, the machine will fail
to boot or may crash after some time.

Note that the available space computed and printed by Config is for V7
UNIX, and so should be decreased by 20k for System V.

For nB bytes of user-defined space, the address range is:
        (#xF0000 - nB) .. #xEFFFF
So, for 64k, that is #xE0000 .. #xEFFFF.
