.chapter ZMAIL

ZMAIL is an extremely powerful display-oriented mail system for BABYL or
RMAIL mail files.  This document describes most of its rather
complicated user interface.

.cindex mail file
.cindex message
The program mostly operates upon two types of objects, 2messages*
and 2mail files*.  As one might suspect, a 2mail file* is a
collection of 2messages*.  There are two kinds of 2mail files*,
those that actually correspond to files on some file computer (whether
they are present there or not), and collections of 2messages* which
exist only during a particular running of the program.  For the most
part in this document, the term 2mail file* can refer to either
type.  When a distinction is to be made, the terms 2disk mail file*
and 2temporary mail file* will be used, respectively.  A 2message*
is always contained in exactly one 2disk mail file* and zero or more
2temporary mail files*.

.section Startup and top level configuration
When started up via (ZMAIL), ZMAIL begins reading in your RMAIL file
and any new mail.  This is done in a background process, so the
display of the first message should come up rapidly.  The background
process will continue to read in those files and write out the updated
RMAIL file, if necessary.  You are therefore allowed some limited
interaction while this is going on.

When invoked by [SYSTEM] M, ZMAIL displays an explanatory message and
allows commands that do not require an mail file.  Clicking on Get New
Mail will start reading in your RMAIL file as above.

.nopara
There are three ZMAIL windows displayed while the program is at top level:

.table 1
.item the Message window
This window displays the text of the current message itself.

.item the Command menu
A menu containing most of the useful top level commands.  See the
section on commands for what they all do.

.item the Mode line
A one line window showing the status of the program.  For example,
.nopara
.exdent 240 "7ZMAIL Option AI: ZIPPY; ZIPPY RMAIL   Msg #3/57  (unseen)  {personal} --More--*"
.br
7Option* means the program is at top level.  Next comes the name of
the current 2mail file*.  73* is the current message number, and
757* the total number of messages in the current file.  7unseen*
means this is the first time the message has been displayed; other
things that go inside the parentheses are 7deleted*, 7recent* and
7last*, meaning the last message in the file.  Inside the braces are
any user keywords which have been saved on this message.
'cindex keywords
7--More--* is displayed when there is more text of the message below the
end of this screenful.

Some of the items in the mode line are mouse sensitive at various times.
See the section on the various commands for what parts these are and
what clicking on them does.
.end_table

.section Top level commands
.nopara
These are the commands available in the main command menu.  In general,
clicking left on one of them does its default action and clicking right
gets another menu of suboptions.  Whenever a command can be invoked by
both the menu and the keyboard, the keyboard version is equivalent to
clicking left, that is it gives the default behavior.

.table
.item Summarize
Changes the display from just the current message and the command menu
to the summary window, the command menu and the current message.  See
the section on the summary window for what is displayed there.

.item Select file
Clicking left selects the 2mail file* that was last selected before
this one.  Clicking right gives a two column menu with the 2disk mail
files* in the left column and the 2temporary mail files* in the
right.  Clicking on one of these selects that 2mail file*.

.nopara
In addition, there are these special options in italics in the menu:

.table
.item Find file
Reads the name of a file from the keyboard and reads in and selects that
mail file.

.item Mark survey
Enters marking survey mode and selects a 2temporary mail file* of the
marked messages when exited.  See the section on marking survey mode in
the description of the summary window, below.

.item Filter
Selects a temporary mail file of messages chosen by a filter.  See the
section on filtering  for how this specification is done.

.item Abort
Aborts the Select File command.

.end_table


.item Delete 2also gotten by typing 3D**
.nopara
Deletes a message.  There are two types of deletion commands.  Clicking
right gets a menu of the two.

.table
.item Delete
Marks a message as deleted relative to the 2disk mail file* that is is
contained in.  If 3zwei:*delete-after-next** is not 3nil*, then moves
on to the next message.  This is also what clicking left does.

.item Remove
Actually immediately removes the current message from the current
2temporary mail file*.  This is useful for getting rid of just a few
messages for the 2Map Over* command, for example.

.end_table
.item Undelete
Searches starting with the current message and then backward for a
deleted message and unmarks it as deleted and selects it.

.item Reply 2also gotten by typing 3R**
Sets things up for mailing a reply to the current message.  There are
two variables relevant to the initial setup of the reply.  These are the
2reply mode* and the 2reply window mode*.  Clicking right gets a
menu of these, and clicking left defaults them to
3zwei:*default-reply-mode** and 3zwei:*default-reply-window-mode**,
respectively.
.nopara
These are the possible choices for 2reply mode*, which controls to
whom the reply is addressed.

.table
.item All
All of the original recipients of the message.

.item All-Cc
All of the original recipients of the message, except Cc: everyone
except the original sender, rather than To:.

.item Cc-All
All the original recipients, except Cc: the sender of the message.
This is useful for replying to messages to mailing lists to the
mailing list itself.

.item To
Just the sender and original To: recipients of the message.

.item To-Cc
To: the sender, and Cc: the original To: recipients.

.item Cc-To
To: the original To: recipients, Cc: the sender.

.item Sender
Just the sender of the message.

.end_table

.nopara
These are the possible choices for 2reply window mode*, which controls
how the display is initially configured.

.table
.item Two-windows
Reply is in two windows, with the message being replied to at the top.

.item One-window
Only the reply being composed is displayed, not the original message.

.item Yank
Display only the reply, and also yank the text of the original message,
indented, into the text of the reply.

.end_table

.item Find string
Print out all lines in messages containing a string which is read from
the terminal.  The lines printed are mouse sensitive and clicking on
them selects that message.

.item Keywords
Add keywords to all messages.  See the Keywords command for how to
interact with the keywords menu.

.item Unkeywords
Remove keywords from all messages.

.item Move to file
Move all messages into a file.  See the Move to File command for how to
specify that file.

.item Sort
.nopara

.item Keywords
Sort by what keywords are present on the message.

.item Text
Sort alphabetically by the actual text of the message.

.item Length

.end_table
.nopara
The menu also allows specifying in which direction the messages should
be ordered after that sort.
.table
.item Forward

.item Backward

.end_table

concatenation of the text of all messages, and mark all messages except
the first as deleted.  Useful for combining several messages on the same subject.

.end_table
.item Save files 2also gotten by typing 3S**
Clicking left expunges and saves all mail files.  Clicking right gives a
multiple choose menu, like the one the Kill or Save Buffers command in the
editor uses, with the following options for each mail file.

.table
.item Expunge
Remove all deleted messages from this mail file.

.item Save
Write the file back to disk if it has been changed.

daring, you can give this option and go away before the saving finishes.

.end_table
.item Survey
Prints the summary lines for messages selected according to a filter.
See the section on filters for how to specify one and the section on the
summary window for the format of the lines printed out.  The lines
printed are mouse sensitive and clicking on them selects the
corresponding message.

.item Get new mail 2also gotten by typing 3G**
If there is new mail on the file computer, start reading it in.

.item Move to file
Moves a message into a mail file.  Since a message can only reside in
one 2disk mail file* and any number of 2temporary mail files*,
moving a message into a 2disk mail file* means actually copying the
message and its text, whereas moving into a 2temporary mail file* only
stores the 2message* into that data structure.  Clicking left moves
into the same mail file as the last move to file command.  Clicking
right gives a menu of all the current mail files, clicking one of them
moves the message into that file.

.nopara
In addition, there are the following special options in italics in the menu:

.table
.item New temporary
Read the name of a new 2temporary mail file* from the keyboard and
start it out with this message.

.item Recycled temporary
The same 2temporary mail file* that the filter opterations would have
used.

.item New file
Read the name of a 2disk mail file* from the keyboard, read in from
the file computer if it exists, and add this message to it.

.item Hardcopy
Prints the message on some hardcopy device, see the section on hardcopy.

.item Abort
Abort the Move to file command.

.end_table
.item Keywords
Change the current message's keywords.  Clicking left performs the same
additions and substractions to this message's keywords as the last
keywords command.  Clicking right gives the keyword menu.  This menu
contains all the currently defined keywords.   Keywords that are
currently on this message will be highlighted.  Clicking on a keyword
complements the highlighting.

.nopara
In addition, there are the following special items in italics:

.table
.item Quit
Aborts the Keywords command.

.item Done
Finishes up, the message will get all the highlighted keywords.

.item New
Reads the name of a new keyword from the keyboard, adds it to the list
of possible keywords and to the keyword menu, and highlights it.

.end_table
.item Mail 2also gotten by typing 3M**
Sets things up for sending a message.  See the section on sending mail for
how to continue from there.

.nopara
Clicking right gives a menu of various special setup modes for mailing.

.table

and text fields of the message the same way as the M-X Bug command in
the editor.

.item Mail
Normal mail setup.

.item Forward
Copies the current message into the text portion of the message being composed.

.end_table
.item Other
Gives a menu of other commands and executes the chosen one.  By default
there are no other commands.  See the section on init files for how to
define some commands and add them to this list.

.end_table

.nopara
Typing digits accumulates an argument for the next command.  Most
commands do not do anything with their argument.  These are the commands
only available from the keyboard:
.table
.item Break 2gotten by typing 3BREAK**
Gives a break loop.

.item Delete And Up 2gotten by typing 3C-D**

These are the commands gotten by clicking on mouse senstive parts of the mode line.
.table
.item Keywords
Gotten by clicking on the keywords in braces, the same as the Keywords
command in the main command menu.

.item Rename Mail File
Gotten by clicking on the filename.  Reads a new name from the keyboard
and changes the name of the current mail file to that.
.end_table

means do not indent.

.end_table

.section The summary window
The summary window is a scroll window which displays a single line for
each message in the current mail file.  Each line is mouse sensitive
and clicking left on a line selects the message corresponding to that
line.  Clicking right gives menu of operations on that message.  (For
exceptions to this rule, see the section on defining a new filter.)
There are two possible formats for the summary line, one which
displays the date, and one which does not.  This is controlled by
3zwei:*summary-include-date**.  For example,
.nopara
.exdent 240 "7  3:   30 GLS(BUG ZWEI)          {feature zwei} Suggestions for C-Q (Various Quantities)*"
.exdent 240 "7  3:   30  1-Jul GLS(BUG ZWEI)          {feature zwei} Suggestions for C-Q (Various Quan*"
.br
73* is the number of the message relative to this mail file.  Numbers are
provided for counting purposes only, there are no absolute numbers.  7:* is the
status letter of the message.
.nopara
Possible status letters are, in reverse order of predicate precedence:
.table 7
.item -
The message is unseen, i.e. it has not been displayed yet.

.item :
The message has been seen before.

.item A
The message has been answered.

.item D
The message is deleted.
.end_table
730* is the number of lines in the message.  The sender and recipients
of the message are summarized on either side of the 7*.  The keywords
for the message are enclosed in braces.  The rest of the line is either
the subject of the message, or the first line which appears to contain
meaningful text.  In addition, the current message will have a small
arrow in the leftmost column of its survey line.

.subsection Marking survey mode
Marking survey mode is the simplest way to get a set of (a small number
of) messages for the Map Over commands.  When in marking survey mode,
clicking on a line in the summary window complements its marked status.
Marked messages have a small 7x*-like blob in the leftmost column.
Typing 3END* will select a temporary mail file of the marked messages.
Typing 3ABORT* will abort marking survey mode.  Also, mousing most any
other command will first select the marked messages and then execute the
command.  This is the easy way to start the Map Over command you
presumably wanted to do.

.section Filtering
In order for the operations available in the Map Over menu to be
generally useful, one needs to be able to collect messages which fit a
particular predicate into a 2temporary mail file*.  This collection is
assembled by mapping a 2filter* over a 2universe* of messages.  A
2filter* is simply a predicate, a function on a 2message*.  A
2universe* is just a collection of messages.  Usually it is nothing
more than a 2mail file*, but see below.  This same filtering operation
is performed by the Survey command to decide which messages to print.

.subsection Choosing a filter
.nopara
When the user is called upon to select a filter, the filter selection
frame is exposed over the rest of the window.  These are the windows in
the filter selection frame and what they do:
.table 1
.item The universe button
This window has the name of the 2universe* the 2filter* will be
applied to.  Normally, this is the current 2mail file*.  Clicking on
it allows choosing another 2universe*.  See the section on Choosing a
universe below for how that works.

.item The not button
This window just says 7not* on it.  Clicking on it complements its
highlight.  If it is highlighted when you finally select the 2filter*
(see below), then the complement of the predicate is used instead.

.item The abort button
This window just says 7abort* on it.  Clicking on it aborts the filter
selection, which probably aborts the current command, such as Select
File or Survey.

.item Keywords
Each keyword that is defined is displayed in a menu.  Clicking on an
item in that menu selects the 2filter* that gets 2messages* with that
keyword on them.  Also, the item 2Any*, in italics, gives a 2filter*
for all messages with any keywords at all on them.

.item System filters
.nopara
A number of filters are pre-defined.  These are the ones displayed in
the middle menu and what messages they filter.
.table
.item All
Gives all messages.  If you don't select a different 2universe*, you
won't get a different set of messages and won't have accomplished
anything, so see below for how to do that.

.item Deleted
Messages marked as deleted

.item Seen
Messages which have been displayed before.

.item Recent
Messages read as new mail during this session.

.item Answered
Messages to which a reply has been sent using the Reply command.
.end_table

.item User filters
A menu of any 2filters* that the user has defined is also given.
Also, the item 2New filter* appears in italics.  Selecting it will let
you define a new filter.  See below for how that works.
.end_table

.subsection Defining a new filter
.cindex filter
When defining a new filter, the screen is split between the summary
window and the filter definition frame.  The summary window displays the
current mail file.  See the section on it for the format of the display.
Clicking on its mouse sensitive lines gives several lines of mouse
sensitive typeout showing the sender and recipients of the corresponding
message.  Clicking on them adds clauses to match those fields, just like
the From or To/Cc commands below.

On the right of filter definition window is an editor, which shows the
LISP definition of the filter you are defining.  Usually it will contain
logical expressions on pre-defined macros, gotten automatically by
clicking on the various other windows.  However, clicking on it will
allow you to edit the LISP itself.  See the section on filter macros to
help interpret things there.  Here is an example of a simple filter which
gets all deleted messages from Moon at MIT-MC.

.lisp
(define-filter foo (msg)
  (and (get status ':deleted)
       (msg-header-recipient-search ':from "Moon@MIT-MC")))
.end_lisp

.nopara
The other windows in the filter definition frame are:
.table 1
.item Not button
This window just says not in it, clicking it inserts code which will complement the
next clause inserted.

.item And button
Starts an 3and* conditional, into which following clauses are filled in.

.item Or button
Starts and 3or* conditional.

.item Close button
This moves to the next higher level of nested clauses.  In fact which it
does is what M-) does in the editor.  That is to say, if you click And,
then Or, then some clauses for the Or, and now want to get back to
adding the rest of the And clauses, this is how you do it.

.item Sample button
Clicking this shows what messages fit the filter as so far defined, just
the the Survey command at top level.

.item Name button
This has the name of the filter you are defining, initially something
like NONAME-1.  Clicking left on it lets you change the name of the new
filter.  Clicking right gives you a menu of already defined filters
and lets you select one which is then inserted with its definition.
This is how you edit an existing filter definition.

.item Done button
Finishes up defining the filter.

.item Abort button
Aborts the filter definition, and probably whatever command it was called from.

.item Keyword menu
Similar to the Keyword menu in the filter selection frame, except that choosing
something inserts a clause for matching messages with that keyword.

.item System filter menu
Similar to the menu in the filter selection frame, except that it too inserts
clauses which match the corresponding predicate.
.nopara
There are also a few other items in the menu:
.table
.item Filed
Gives messages which have been moved to another 2disk mail file*.

.item Search
Reads a string from the mini-buffer (over there below the editor window)
and gives a clause which matches messages containing that string.
.end_table

.item Headers menu
Clicking on the items in this menu reads a string from the mini-buffer
and gives a clause for messages that match that string in the
corresponding string.  When you are reading in that mini-buffer,
clicking in the survey window will insert the text of the corresponding
field in the message that corresonds to that line in the survey, giving
a menu in the typeout window if there is more than recipient in that field.

.nopara
These are the headers that appear in the headers menu:
.table
.item To
Match on the to field of the message.

.item To/cc
Match on either the to or the cc field of the message, i.e. any
recipient of the message.

.item From
Match the from field.

.item Subject
Match the subject field.

.item Other
First reads the name of a header (presumably other than To, From, or
Subject) and then the search string, and search that particular header
for the string.
.end_table

.item Date menu
.nopara
Clicking on these items reads a date from the mini-buffer and inserts a
clause for the corresponding time predicate.
.table
.item Before
Gets messages dated before the given date.

.item On
Gets messages dated within 24 hours of the given date.

.item After
Gets messages dates after the given date.
.end_table

.subsection Choosing a universe
.cindex universe
The menu for selecting a universe contains the names of all mail files,
and already defined universes (see below).  Clicking on one of these
selects the correponding set of messages for the universe of in which
the filter is conducted.  Also, the item 2All*, in italics, appears,
which means all messages in any mail file; and the item 2New
universe*, which allows definition of a new universe, as below.

A universe which is not a mail file does not correspond to a
particular set of messages until it is used for filtering.  It is in
this way that it differs from a mail file.  Mail files used in it are
specified by name, not by their messages.

.subsection Defining a universe
.cindex cosmogony
To define a new universe, the universe definition frame pops up.  It has
an editor window just like the Filter definition frame; in fact,
definition works much the same way, except that set operations, rather
than logical operations, are applied to collections of messages, rather
than to filtering clauses.

.nopara
The other windows in the universe definition frame are:
.table 1
.item Name button
This has the name of the universe you are defining, initially something
like NONAME-1.  Clicking left on it lets you change the name of the new
universe.  Clicking right gives you a menu of already defined universes
and lets you select one which is then inserted with its definition.
This is how you edit an existing universe definition.

.item Done button
When done, returns the newly defined universe

.item Abort button
Aborts the definition of the new universe, and returns to the filter
frame probably.

.item Union button
Gives the union of the succeeding collections.  Union of no arguments is
the empty set.

.item Intersection button
Gives the intersection of the succeeding collections.  Intersection of
no arguments in everything, in this case all messages anywhere.

.item Not button
Gives the complement of the suceeding collection.

.item Close button
Moves up a level of union or intersection, just like the close button in
the filter definition frame, or M-) in the editor.

.item Disk mail files
A menu of all disk mail files appears on the left.  In addition, the
item 2Primary* in italics, which means the file that was read in to
startup and to which your new mail is appended, i.e. your RMAIL file.

.item Temporary mail files
A menu of all temporary sets of messages appears in the middle.  In addition,
the item 2Current*, which means the currently selected mail file.

.item Universe menu
A menu of all the universes you have already defined also appears,
clicking it uses that collection of messages.
.end_table

.section Profile mode
.cindex user options
.cindex init file
When ZMAIL starts up, it 3load*'s the file HSNAME;UNAME ZMAIL, if it
exists.  This init file can define filters, 3setq* variables (see
below under user options), etc.  Profile mode gives a convenient
interface for helping to edit up this file.

[More to come]

.section User options
.cindex user options
.cindex init file
.nopara
These are the user options and what they mean, they are all in the ZWEI
package.  Your init file probably should be also for convenience.

.item *next-after-delete* 2boolean, default 3t**
Whether to move to the next message after deleting the current one.

.item *delete-after-move-to-file* 2boolean, default 3t**

.item :network
.end_table

.item *reply-window-mode* 2assoc, default 3:two-windows**

.section Filter alist processing
.cindex filter
.cindex init file
Some functions are defined which give an interactive scrolling display
of the text of messages and allow putting keywords on messages, deleting
them, at the same time.  They aren't all that well thought out yet.  If
you want to experiment with them, look in MMcM's init file for examples
of how to use them.
