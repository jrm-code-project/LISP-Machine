M-FEF means "The register (available as a functional source & dest) that points to
             the current function."

Addressing modes:

  9 bits, 3 bits of base register, 6 bits of displacement

  base registers:
    0 FEF
    1 FEF+64.
    2 FEF+128.
    3 FEF+192.
    4 CONSTANT
    5 LOCAL
    6 ARG
    7 PDL-POP

Effective address computation:

FEF
    VMA-START-READ <- M-FEF + displacement
    Follow "all" invisible pointers leaving VMA pointing to final cell, and MD with its contents

FEF+64.
    VMA-START-READ <- M-FEF + 64. + displacement

FEF+128. same
FEF+192. same

CONSTANT
    VMA-START-READ <- A-V-CONSTANTS-PAGE + displacement
    no invisible pointer following needed

LOCAL
    PDL-INDEX <- A-LOCALP + displacement
    EA is PDL-INDEX, value is PDL-INDEX-INDIRECT

ARG
    PDL-INDEX <- M-AP + displacement + 1
    EA is PDL-INDEX, value is PDL-INDEX-INDIRECT

PDL-POP
    displacement is unused
    can't be used as a destination, so EA is meaningless
    value is top of PDL
    PDL is popped


Destinations:
D-IGNORE
  for side effects only
D-PDL
  push on stack
D-LAST
  activate a function call
D-RETURN
  return this value from this function

The main instructions are written 4 times, each customized to the particualr case.
MISC instructions arrange to do their work, the return to routines to store into
the destination.

class I, with destination
 CALL
 CALL0
  Address is usually FEF, destination will be used much later

Simple data movement
 MOVE
 CAR
 CDR
 CADR
 CDDR
 CDAR
 CAAR
  All move from address to destination.  All combinations of address and destination are
enumerated.

Class II

Simple binary ops
 +
 -
 *
 //
 LOGAND
 LOGXOR
 LOGIOR
 =
 >
 <
 EQ

E.g.  Top-of-stack <- Top-of-stack + (EA)
Stack level is not changed.  EA may be in stack (ARG, LOCAL), or in memory.

"Loop steppers"
 SETE-CDR
 SETE-CDDR
 SETE-1+
 SETE-1-
Read the EA, do the op, write the EA.

 BIND-NIL  - Bind the EA to NIL,  stack is unused
 BIND-POP  - Bind the EA to value on top of stack, pop stack
 SET-NIL   - Set EA to NIL
 SET-ZERO  - Set EA to 0
 PUSH-E    - Push virtual address of EA on stack
 MOVEM     - Move value on top of stack to EA, stack height unchanged
 POP       - POP stack into EA


Branch conditional on result of last instruction.  We don't keep condition bits.
Instead, the value of the last instruction is always stored in M-T (a random M register),
and it is tested as necessary during a branch instruction.
Part of the branch instruction is a 9 bit two's complement displacement.  0 = branch
to the next instruction (where you would go if this were a normal instruction.)
All ones (which would mean jump to the jump instruction itself) means this is a long
branch, and the next word contains the branch offset as a 16 bit two's complement number.
 BR
 BR-NIL
 BR-NOT-NIL
 BR-NIL-POP     branch if NIL, otherwise, POP stack (discard the result)
 BR-NOT-NIL-POP same
 BR-ATOM        jump if data type of M-T is not DTP-LIST
 BR-NOT-ATOM    similar

MISC
Misc instructions have a destination, plus a 10. bit misc number.  (actually, the
10. bits are split into 9 bits and 1 bit in the current instructions)
If the dest is not D-IGNORE, we push the micro-address of an exit routine onto
the microstack, then in any case, jump to MACRO-IR-DECODE[misc-number].
Some misc instructions pop the micro-control-stack if the destination is not
D-IGNORE so they can use those 2 bits for other purposes.

Conditional stack manipulations
 PUSH-CDR-IF-CAR-EQUAL          If the top of stack is a CONS, and its car is EQ to (EA),
                                then replace the top-of-stack with its cdr, and put T in M-T.
                                Otherwise just put NIL in M-T

 PUSH-CDR-STORE-CAR-IF-CONS     If the top-of-stack is a CONS, store its car in the EA,
                                and replace the top-of-stack with its cdr, and put T in M-T.
                                Otherwise just put NIL in M-T


Stack closure stuff
 STACK-CLOSURE-DISCONNECT
 STACK-CLOSURE-UNSHARE
 MAKE-STACK-CLOSURE
 STACK-CLOSURE-DISCONNECT-FIRST
Do random stack closure stuff.  The whole REG/DISPLACEMENT field is used for immediate data.

 PUSH-NUMBER
Push the whole 9 bit REG/DISPLACEMENT file on the stack as a positive fixnum.

Below "overlap" with Class I instructions, so are decoded strangely:

AREF/IREF IMMEDIATE
These use the normal meaning for destination, but REG/DISPLACEMENT field is immediate data.
 AR-1
 ARRAY-LEADER
 %INSTANCE-REF
 COMMON-LISP-AR-1
 SET-AR-1
 SET-ARRAY-LEADER
 SET-%INSTANCE-REF



These three use one class I "overlap" opcode, and use the dest field as an opcode.
All read the EA, operate, then store the EA
