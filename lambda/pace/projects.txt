incremental micro assembler - about 70K new code in 1 week real time = 50 PH
PHm = requires microcode proficency

MENU DIRED
marketing people want this - user interface will do it
fairly simple front end to current program

SPEED UP FILE SYSTEM
 1. extract useful disk routines from lambda diag to replace user microcode disk ops
    - 50 PH
 2. implement conventional, interrupt based block queuing for new disk routines
    (simulate interrupts  with processes)
    - 50 PH
 3. activate code to use 1K chaos buffers
    - 25 PH
 4. implement a better way to delete many files at one time
    - 20 PH
 5. evaluate resulting speed to see if more is required

AUTO REPEAT KEYS
 1. make microcode store time that each character from the keyboard is put in the input buffer
    - 5 PHm
 2. make clock level fuction to notice a key down for long enough and keep stuffing it in
    - 20 PH
 3. deal with bad interactions - such a change will have many
    - 20 PH

DIRECT PHYSICAL QUANTUM TRANSLATIONS
 This will allow us to do many new things.  The most important are :
Runtime allocated shared memory between processors with
unlimited size; multiple displays for one lisp processor
 1. put it in the microcode
    - 20 PHm
 2. lisp functions to make shared arrays
    - 20 PH
 3. unix functions to make shared arrays
    - 20 - 100 {Bob/Greg}H
 4. network based rendevous protocols
    - 30 PH

FAST BOOT
 1. Finish DIRECT PHYSICAL QUANTUM TRANSLATIONS, above
 2. add microcode to specify disk areas instead of physical addresses for quantums
    - 20 PHm
 3. microcode to set up quantum table
    - 30 PHm
 4. microcode to move dirty quantums to PAGE area
    - 20 PHm
 5. updates to keep the LAM program working
    - 10 PH

ENABLE SYSTEM TO USE SMALL PAGE BAND
 This will allow a machine to be fully functional with a disk of around 60 Mb.
 1. Finish FAST BOOT
 2. microcode to allocate PAGE space dynamically
    - 30 PHm
 3. updates for LAM program
    - 10 PH

MAKE SYSTEM BOOTABLE WITHOUT DISPLAY
 1. make a new kind of stream that can connect TERMINAL-IO to a pair of IO-BUFFERs
    - 40 PH
 2. write TERMCAP type program to connect such a pair of IO-BUFFERs to conventional terminals
    - 40 PH
 3. design and implement a "job control" type of user interface
    - 40 PH
 4. install a system variable to make the cold-load-stream, initial-lisp-listener and background errors use such a stream
    - 20 PH
 5. install a system variable to shut down the window system
    - 30 PH
 6. make it possible to build bands without the window system at all
    - 100 PH
