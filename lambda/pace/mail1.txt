This has only happened once, but I am starting a policy of trying to
track down every error.  We should have a mailing list and an archive
for this sort of thing.

While executing the following stream (I've put the instructions in the
order they were executed so you don't have to worry about call and
return addresses.)

  ;this read works OK
        ((VMA-START-READ M-2) ADD M-2 A-E)
        (call-if-page-fault ...)
  ;now it modifies the MD
        ((IMOD-LOW) A-ALUF)
        ((M-TEM) SETZ MD A-BITBLT-TEM)
        ((M-TEM1) MD)
        ((IMOD-LOW) M-K)
  ;now it writes back the modified MD
        ((MD-START-WRITE)
                SELECTIVE-DEPOSIT M-TEM (BYTE-FIELD 0 0) A-TEM1)
        (call-if-page-fault ...)
  ;this jump happens
        (JUMP-GREATER-THAN-XCT-NEXT M-4 (A-CONSTANT 1) BITBLT-INNER-3)
       ((M-4) SUB M-4 (A-CONSTANT 1))

BITBLT-INNER-3
  ;ERROR:  M-1 gets the right thing, but the VMA keeps the same value
  ;        that was written on the first instruction above, namely, the
  ;        value that is still in M-2
        ((VMA-START-READ M-1) ADD M-1 A-B)
        (call-if-page-fault ...)
        ((IMOD-LOW) DPB M-I OAL-MROT A-ZERO)
  ;Machine hangs here waiting for the MD.  The CSM is in the
  ;READ-REQUEST-ERROR loop.  The VMA, as I said, still contains the
  ;value for the first read, and the location that maps to (on a VCMEM
  ;video buffer) can still be read from the other lambda of the 2x2.
        ((A-BITBLT-TEM) (BYTE-FIELD 32. 0) MD)

Ken K. says the bit that says whether the destination field of the
micro-instruction is an A memory address or a combined M/Functional
address might have been been too slow for what ever it is that enables a
write on the VMA.  I tried to determine if any other M function
destination was written, but I can't be sure if I checked everything.
I'm reasonablly sure none of the following were clobbered:

        pdl-pointer, or c-pdl-pointer-[push or pop]
        pdl-index, or c-pdl-index-[push or pop]
        location-counter
        rg-mode
        dp-mode
        stat-counter
        stat-counter-aux
        usp, or micro-stack push or pop
        L1 or L2 maps

The lam program has clobbered the macro-ir on me, so I don't know if it
might have been bad before; however, I have no reason to suspect it.

Call me if you have any questions.

Pace

The file server processes are sensitive to the value of *print-case*
when they print out transaction ID's.  The other machine will think it's
got an invalid transaction ID in the reply as a result.

    In Experimental System 110.27... Alpha-1 Release, on Mary had a
    little Lambda (LAMBDA):

    This happened after doing C-X, C-F to read in a file from
    angel.  Trying to read it in from dired didn't work either.
    The file is a botex file.

    >>ERROR: Cannot convert #2/i into a string.
    Backtrace from the debugger:

    STRING (P.C. = 73)

     Arg 0 (X): #2/i

    Additional information supplied with call:
     Expecting 3 values

    (:PROPERTY :LISP ZWEI::GET-SECTION-NAME) (P.C. = 84) (from file LAD: MT; ZWOBL.#)

There's your (or maybe Mike Travers') problem.  See the filename above ?
This is a redefined version of a system function; it's not the default
of the system software as far as it can be determined -- does this file
work in 102 ?  (I noticed that STRING has a character with a font in
it.)

How did this file get loaded ?  Did you load it yourself ?  This better
not be something the system loads in, because you're not supposed to use
physical pathnames for systems that go outside LMI.

Subject: Another reason SI::ANALYZE-CHANGED-FILES doesn't work in 110
To: BUG-LISPM@LMI-Angel
Message-Id: <[LMI-DAVID-BYRNE].11-Feb-86 22:31:18.RpK>

In Experimental System 110.38, Experimental ZMail 65.3,
Experimental Unix-Interface 9.0, Experimental Local-File 66.0,
Experimental MagTape 4.1, Experimental FILE-Server 18.1,
Experimental Lambda-Diag 3.0, microcode 1368, Nifty,
on David Byrne (LAMBDA):

SI::ANALYZE-CHANGED-FILES will barf in the current system when walking
down the debugging info of certain :INTERNAL functions; usually the
error is trying to take the CAR of :MACROS-EXPANDED while looking at the
function (:INTERNAL FORMAT::FORMAT-CTL-CHARACTER FORMAT::PRINT-BITS).
Probably the unmodular compiler builds debugging info correctly for
normal functions, but not for :INTERNAL ones.

Of course, there's always CAR-SAFE, but a compiler bug like this could
have other unforeseen and painful consequences (in the debugger,
perhaps).
