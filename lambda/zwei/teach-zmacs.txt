You are looking at the ZMacs tutorial.  Comments on this document should be
sent to Dulcey@MIT-OZ.

ZMacs is the editor used on the Lisp Machine.  It is based on ZWEI, an editing
subsystem.  Certain other programs on the Lisp Machine, such as ZMail and
Converse, also use ZWEI.  When you are editing text in these programs, it will
be with the same commands documented here.  They also have other commands
of their own.

ZMacs commands generally involve the 1Control* key or the 1Meta* key.  Rather than
write out 1Meta* or 1Control* each time we want you to prefix a character, we'll use
the following abbreviations:

        1C-2char**  means hold the 1Control* key while typing the character
                        2char*. Thus, 1C-F* would be: hold the 1Control* key and type 1F*.
        1M-2char**  means hold the 1Meta* key down while typing 2char*.
        1C-M-2char**        means hold both the 1Control* key and the 1Meta* key down while
                        typing 2char*.

Important note: if you must exit at some point, you can use the 1System* key to
take you elsewhere.  1System* 1E* will get you back here.

The characters "1>>*" at the left margin indicate directions for you to try using a
command.

The first thing that you need to know is how to move around from place to place
in the file.  1C-V *moves you forward to the next screen of text.  1M-V* takes you
back to the previous screen.

1>>*  Now type 1C-V* (Next Screen) to move to the next screen.
        (go ahead, do it by depressing the 1Control* key and 1V* together).  Then type
        1M-V *to get back here.

From now on, you'll be expected to do this whenever you finish reading the
screen.

Note that there is an overlap when going from screen to screen; this provides
some continuity when moving through the file.


2SUMMARY*

The following commands are useful for viewing screenfuls:

        1C-V* Move forward one screenful
        1M-V* Move backward one screenful
        1C-L* Clear screen and redisplay everything putting the text
                near the cursor at the center.

1>>*  Find the cursor and remember what text is near it.
        Then type a 1C-L*.
        Find the cursor again and see what text is near it now.


2BASIC CURSOR CONTROL*

Getting from screenful to screenful is useful, but how do you reposition yourself
within a given screen to a specific place?  There are several ways you can do
this.  One way (not the best, but the most basic) is to use the commands
previous, backward, forward and next.  As you can imagine these commands
(which are given to ZMacs as 1C-P*, 1C-B*, 1C-F*, and 1C-N* respectively) move the
cursor from where it currently is to a new place in the given direction.  Here, in a
more graphical form are the commands:

                          Previous line, 1C-P*
                                  :
                                  :
   Backward, 1C-B* .... Current cursor position .... Forward, 1C-F*
                                  :
                                  :
                          Next line, 1C-N*

You'll probably find it easy to think of these by letter.  1P* for previous, 1N* for
next, 1B* for backward and 1F* for forward.  These are the basic cursor positioning
commands and you'll be using them ALL the time so it would be of great benefit if
you learn them now.

1>>*  Do a few 1C-N*'s to bring the cursor down to this line.

1>>*  Move into the line with 1C-F*'s and then up with 1C-P*'s.
        See what 1C-P* does when the cursor is in the middle of the line.

Lines are separated by a 1Return* character.

1>>*  Try to 1C-B* at the beginning of a line.  Do a few more 1C-B*'s.
        Then do 1C-F*'s back to the end of the line and beyond.

When you go off the top or bottom of the screen, the text beyond the edge is
shifted onto the screen so that your instructions can be carried out while keeping
the cursor on the screen.

1>>*  Try to move the cursor off the bottom of the screen with 1C-N* and
        see what happens.

If moving by characters is too slow, you can move by words.  1M-F* moves
forward a word and 1M-B* moves back a word.

4>>*  Type a few 1M-F*'s and 1M-B*'s.  Intersperse them with 1C-F*'s and 1C-B*'s.

Notice the parallel between 1C-F* and 1C-B* on the one hand, and 1M-F* and 1M-B* on
the other hand.  Very often 1Meta* characters are used for operations related to
English text whereas 1Control* characters operate on the basic textual units that
are independent of what you are editing (characters, lines, etc).  There is a similar
parallel between lines and sentences: 1C-A* and 1C-E* move to the beginning or end
of a line, and 1M-A* and 1M-E* move to the beginning or end of a sentence.

1>>*  Try a couple of 1C-A*'s, and then a couple of 1C-E*'s.
        Try a couple of 1M-A*'s, and then a couple of 1M-E*'s.

See how repeated 1C-A*'s do nothing, but repeated 1M-A*'s keep moving farther.  Do
you think that this is right?

Two other simple cursor motion commands are 1M-<*, which moves to the
beginning of the file, and 1M->*, which moves to the end of the file.  You probably
don't need to try them, since finding this spot again will be boring.

The location of the cursor in the text is also called "point".  To paraphrase, the
cursor shows on the screen where point is located in the text.

Here is a summary of simple moving operations including the word and sentence
moving commands:

        1C-F* Move forward a character
        1C-B* Move backward a character

        1M-F* Move forward a word
        1M-B* Move backward a word

        1C-N* Move to next line
        1C-P* Move to previous line

        1C-A* Move to beginning of line
        1C-E* Move to end of line

        1M-A* Move back to beginning of sentence
        1M-E* Move forward to end of sentence

        1M-<* Go to beginning of file
        1M->* Go to end of file

1>>*  Try all of these commands now a few times for practice.
        Since the last two will take you away from this screen,
        you can come back here with 1M-V*'s and 1C-V*'s.  These are
        the most often used commands.

Like all other commands in ZMacs, these commands can be given arguments which
cause them to be executed repeatedly.  The way you give a command a repeat
count is by holding down the 1Control* key, the 1Meta* key, or both, while typing
digits; then type the command.

For instance, 1C-8* 1C-F* moves forward eight characters.

1>>*  Try giving a suitable argument to 1C-N* or 1C-P* to come as close
        as you can to this line in one jump.

Two exceptions to this is the screen moving commands, 1C-V* and 1M-V*.  When
given an argument, they scroll the screen up or down by that many lines, rather
than screenfuls.

1>>*  Try typing 1C-8* 1C-V* now.

Did it scroll the screen up by 8 lines?  If you would like to scroll it down you can
give an argument to 1M-V*.

Another exception is the redisplay comand 1C-L*.  When given an argument, it
causes the line where the cursor is located to be displayed that many lines from
the top of the screen.

1>>*  Try typing 1C-0 C-L*.  This line should move to the top of the screen.

2WHEN ZMacs IS HUNG*

If ZMacs gets into an infinite (or simply very long) computation which you don't
want to finish, you can stop it safely by typing 1C-Abort*.  You can also use
1C-Abort* to discard a numeric argument or the beginning of a command that you
don't want to finish.
3
1>>**        Type 1C-100* to make a numeric arg of 100, then type 1C-Abort*.
        Now type 1C-F*.  How many characters does it move?


2INSERTING AND DELETING*

If you want to type text, just do it.  Characters which you can see, such as 1A*, 17*,
1**, etc. are taken by ZMacs as text and inserted immediately.  Type 1Return* to
insert a line separator.

You can delete the last character you typed by typing 1Rubout*.  1Rubout* is a key
on the keyboard.1 *More generally, 1Rubout* deletes the character immediately before
the current cursor position.  (The Delete key doesn't delete anything.  In fact, it
doesn't do anything at all!)

1>>*  Do this now, type a few characters and then delete them
        by typing 1Rubout* a few times.  Don't worry about this file
        being changed; you won't affect the master tutorial.  This is just
        a copy of it.

1>>*  Now start typing text until you reach the right margin, and keep
        typing.  When a line of text gets too big for one line on the
        screen, the line of text is "continued" onto a second screen line.
        The exclamation mark at the right margin indicates a line which has
        been continued.

1>>*  Use 1Rubout*s to delete the text until the line fits on one screen
        line again.  The continuation line goes away.

1>>*  Move the cursor to the beginning of a line and type 1Rubout*.  This
        deletes the line separator before the line and merges the line onto
        the previous line.  The resulting line may be too long to fit, in
        which case it has a continuation line.

1>>*  Type 1Return* to insert the separator again.

Remember that most ZMacs commands can be given a repeat count; Note that
this includes characters which insert themselves.

1>>*  Try that now -- type 1C-8* 1** and see what happens.

You've now learned the most basic way of typing something in ZMacs and
correcting errors.  You can delete by words or lines as well.  Here is a summary
of the delete operations:

        1Rubout*              delete the character just before the cursor
        1C-D*         delete the next character after the cursor

        1M-Rubout*    kill the word immediately before the cursor
        1M-D*         kill the next word after the cursor

        1C-K*         kill from the cursor position to end of line
        1M-K*         kill to the end of the current sentence

Notice that 1Rubout* and 1C-D* vs 1M-Rubout* and 1M-D* extend the parallel started by
1C-F* and 1M-F* (well, 1Rubout* isn't 2really* a control character, but let's not worry
about that).  1C-K* and 1M-K* are like 1C-E* and 1M-E*, sort of, in that lines are
opposite sentences.

Now suppose you kill something, and then you decide that you want to get it
back?  Well, whenever you kill something bigger than a character, ZMacs saves it
for you.  To yank it back, use 1C-Y*.  Note that you don't have to be in the same
place to do 1C-Y*; This is a good way to move text around.  Also note that the
difference between 2Killing* and 2Deleting* something is that 2Killed* things can be
yanked back, and 2Deleted* things cannot.  Generally, the commands that can
destroy a lot of text save it, while the ones that attack only one character, or
nothing but blank lines and spaces, do not save.

For instance, type 1C-N* a couple times to postion the cursor at some line on this
screen.

1>>*  Do this now, move the cursor and kill that line with 1C-K*.

Note that a single 1C-K* kills the contents of the line, and a second 1C-K* kills the
line itself, and make all the other lines move up.  If you give 1C-K* a repeat count,
it kills that many lines AND their contents.

The text that has just disappeared is saved so that you can retrieve it.  To
retrieve the last killed text and put it where the cursor currently is, type 1C-Y*.

1>>*  Try it; type 1C-Y* to yank the text back.

Think of 1C-Y* as if you were yanking something back that someone took away
from you.  Notice that if you do several 1C-K*'s in a row the text that is killed is
all saved together so that one C1-Y *will yank all of the lines.

1>>*  Do this now, type 1C-K* several times.

Now to retrieve that killed text:

1>>*  Type 1C-Y*.  Then move the cursor down a few lines and type 1C-Y*
        again.  You now see how to copy some text.

What do you do if you have some text you want to yank back, and then you kill
something else?  1C-Y* would yank the more recent kill.  But the previous text is
not lost.  You can get back to it using the 1M-Y* command.  After you have done
1C-Y* to get the most recent kill, typing 1M-Y* replaces that yanked text with the
previous kill.  Typing 1M-Y* again and again brings in earlier and earlier kills.  When
you have reached the text you are looking for, you can just go away and leave it
there.  If you 1M-Y* enough times, you come back to the starting point (the most
recent kill).  3***** Mention that the last eight kills are saved (rather than
being so* 3vague about it).*

1>>*  Kill a line, move around, kill another line.  Then do 1C-Y* to get back
        the second killed line.  Then do 1M-Y* and it will be replaced by the
        first killed line.  Do more 1M-Y*'s and see what you get.  Keep doing
        them until the second kill line comes back, and then a few more.  If
        you like, you can try giving 1M-Y* positive and negative arguments.


2THE MOUSE*

The 2Mouse *(the little white box with three buttons on top which is connected to
your keyboard by a cable) can be used to perform various functions in ZMacs.

The 2Mouse Cursor* tells you where the mouse is currently pointing.  It is an
arrow which points North-North-East while ZMacs is running.  If you move the
mouse, the pointer moves around the screen.  Also, if you point the mouse at a
character (rather than at empty screen), the character is 2highlighted* by
surrounding it with a box.

1>>*  Roll the mouse around.  Watch the mouse cursor move around the screen,
        and how characters are highlighted when you point at them.

You can move the position of the cursor by clicking the left mouse button once.
The cursor moves to wherever the mouse cursor is.  Clicking the left button
twice rapidly performs the inverse operation; the mouse cursor moves to meet
the cursor.

1>>*  Try moving around the cursor and the mouse cursor with mouse clicks.

The mouse can also be used to 2scroll* the text in your buffer (the same thing
that comands like 1C-V* do).  If you move the mouse to the upper right corner of
the screen, you will notice that the mouse cursor changes to a fat arrow.  Rolling
the mouse toward the top of the screen here will let you see more text at the
top of the screen.  Similarly, moving the mouse to the lower right corner will let
you see more text at the bottom.

1>>*  Move the text around a bit with the mouse now.

Moving the mouse to the left side of the screen allows various other sorts of
scrolling.  The mouse cursor will change to a fat double-ended arrow to indicate
this.  Clicking the left button will move the line pointed at to the top of the
screen.  Clicking the right button will move the line which is at the top of the
screen to the location where the mouse cursor is.  Note that a left click will
undo the effect of a right click, and vice versa, if you do not move the mouse
(and you did not reach the beginning or the end of the buffer).

1>>*  Move up and down the screen with left-side clicks.


2FILES*

In order to make the text you edit permanent, you must put it in a file.
Otherwise, it will go away when your invocation of ZMacs goes away.  You put
your editing in a file by 2finding* the file.  What finding means is that you see the
contents of the file in your ZMacs; and, loosely speaking, what you are editing is
the file itself.  However, the changes still don't become permanent until you 2save*
the file.  This is so you can have control to avoid leaving a half-changed file
around when you don't want to.  If you are using a host which supports version
numbers for files (such as ITS, TOPS-20, or VAX-VMS), saving will create a new
version of your file; the original will still be intact until you delete it.

If you look near the botton of the screen you will see a line that starts with
"ZMACS (Fundamental) PS:TEACH-ZMACS.TEXT <your-directory> OZ:" (if you
are logged in to OZ.  The form of the name may be different if you are logged in
to a different host.)  This is the name of your own copy of the text of the
ZMacs tutorial; the file you are now looking at.  Whatever file you find, that file's
name will appear in that precise spot.

The commands for finding and saving files are unlike the other commands you
have learned in that they consist of two characters.  They both start with the
character 1Control-X*.  There is a whole series of commands that start with
1Control-X*; many of them have to do with files, buffers, and related things, and all
of them consist of 1Control-X* followed by some other character.

Another thing about the command for finding a file is that you have to say what
file name you want.  We say the command "reads an argument from the terminal"
(in this case, the argument is the name of the file).  After you type the
command

        1C-X* 1C-F* Find File

ZMacs will ask you for the file name.  You should end the name with the Return
key.  This command will read the file into its own new buffer.  (If you use Find File
on a file which is already in your ZMacs, you will simply be switched to that
buffer; the file is not read in again.)  After this command, you will see the
contents of the file in your ZMacs.  You can edit the contents.  When you wish
to make the changes permanent, issue the command

        1C-X C-S*     Save File

The file will be saved.  If the host file system supports version numbers, a new
version of the file will be created.  When the operation is finished, ZMacs
prints the name and version saved.  You should save fairly often, so that you will
not lose very much work if your Lisp Machine should crash.  (If the host
computer crashes, you can simply wait for it to work again, then retry the save.)

        1C-X C-W*     Write File

This causes the buffer to be written out to a file, like Save File does.  The
difference is that you will be asked for a name to write it under.  This lets you
put your new text in a different place from the original.  (This is especially
useful if your host does not support version numbers!)  The buffer will also be
renamed to the new file name, so any subsequent Save File commands will also
output to the new file.

To make a new file, just find it "as if" it already existed.  Then start typing in
the text.  When you ask to save the file, ZMacs will really create the file with
the text that you have inserted.  From then on, you can consider yourself to be
editing an already existing file.

1>>*  Try finding a new file now.  (The name will depend on which host you are
        logged into.)  Put some text into it, and save it.  When you are done, you can
        come back here with 1C-M-L*.  (More generally, 1C-M-L* returns you to the
        buffer you were editing most recently before the current one.)


2EXTENDING THE COMMAND SET*

There are many, many more ZMacs commands than could possibly be put
on all the control and meta characters.  ZMacs gets around this with
the 1X* (2eXtend*) command.  This comes in two flavors:

        1C-X* Character 2eXtend*.  Followed by one character.
        1M-X* Named command 2eXtend*.  Followed by a long name.

These are commands that are generally useful but used less than the commands
you have already learned about.  You have already seen two of them: the file
commands 1C-X* 1C-F* to Find and 1C-X* 1C-S* to Save.

There are many 1C-X* commands.  The ones you need immediately are:

        1C-X* 1C-F*         Find file.
        1C-X* 1C-S*         Save file.
        1C-X C-W*             Write file.

Named extended commands are commands which are used even less
frequently, or commands which are used only in certain modes.  These
commands are usually called 2functions*.  An example is the function
1Replace String*, which globally replaces one string with another.  When
you type 1M-X*, ZMacs prompts you at the bottom of the screen with
1M-X* and you should type the name of the function you wish to call; in
this case, 1Replace String*.  Just type "1REPL<Return>*" and ZMacs will
complete the name.  You will be prompted for the string to replace; type it
followed by 1Return*.  Then you will be prompted for the new string; type it
followed by 1Return*.

1>>*  Move the cursor to the blank line two lines below this one.
        Then type 1M-X* 1repl<Return>changed<Return>altered<Return>*.

Notice how this line has changed: you've replaced the word 1changed* with 1altered*
wherever it occurs after the cursor.


2MODE LINE*

If ZMacs sees that you are typing commands slowly it shows them to you at the
bottom of the screen in an area called the echo area.  The echo area contains
the bottom three lines of the screen.  The line immediately above them is called
the 2mode line*.  The mode line says something like

        ZMACS (Text) Filename (ver) *

It may contain additional information under some circumstances.  For example, the
mode line you see while editing this file displays the current 2font*.  The mode line
is a very useful information line.

You already know what the filename means -- it is the file you have
found.1 *The star means that you have made changes to the text.  Right after
you find or save a file, there is no star.

The part of the mode line inside the parentheses is to tell you what modes you
are in.  (The default mode is Lisp.  However, a file may specify which mode it
likes in an Attributes List.  This appears as the first line of the file.  This file
specifies Fundamental mode.)  It is an example of a 2major mode*.  There are
several major modes in ZMacs for editing different languages and text, such as
LISP mode, Text mode, etc.  At any time one and only one major mode is active,
and its name can always be found in the mode line just where "Fundamental" is
now.  Each major mode makes a few commands behave differently.  For example,
there are commands for creating comments in a program, and since each
programming language has a different idea of what a comment should look like,
each major mode has to insert comments differently.  Each major mode is the
name of an extended command, which is how you get into the mode.  For example,
1M-X Lisp* 1Mode* is how to get into Lisp mode.

If you are going to edit English language text, you should use Text mode.

1>>*  Type 1M-X Text Mode* to get to Text mode.  Notice how the mode line changes.

Don't worry, none of the commands you have learned changes ZMacs in any
great way.  Major modes are usually like that: commands don't change into
completely unrelated things, but they work a little bit differently.

Major modes are called major because there are also 2minor modes*.  They are
called minor because they aren't alternatives to the major modes, just minor
modifications of them.  Each minor mode can be turned on or off by itself,
regardless of what major mode you are in, and regardless of the other minor
modes.  So you can use no minor modes, or one minor mode, or any
combination of several minor modes.

One minor mode which is very useful, especially for editing English text, is Auto
Fill mode.  When this mode is on, ZMacs breaks the line in between words
automatically whenever the line gets too long.  You can turn this mode on by
doing 1M-X Auto Fill Mode*.  When the mode is on, you can turn it off by doing
1M-X Auto Fill Mode*.  If the mode is off, this function turns it on, and if the mode
is on, this function turns it off.  This is called 2toggling*.

1>>*  Type 1M-X Auto Fill Mode* now.  Then insert a line of "asdf "
        over again until you see it divide into two lines.  You must put in
        spaces between them because Auto Fill breaks lines only at spaces.
        Notice that "Fill" appears in the mode line in addition to the name
        of the major mode, not instead of it.

The margin is usually set at 576 pixels (dots on the screen), but you can change it
with the 1C-X* 1F* command.  You move the cursor where you want the fill column
to be, then type 1C-X* 1F*.  You can also give 1C-X* a numeric argument.  If it less
than 200., it specifies the fill column in characters.  An argument >= 200. specifies
a fill column in pixels.

1>>*  Move the cursor to column 20 (or thereabouts) and type 1C-X F*.  Then type
        some lines and watch ZMacs fill them.

1>>*  Set the fill column back to its original value by typing 1C-X F* with an argument
        of 1576*.


2SEARCHING*

ZMacs can do 2searches* for strings (these are groups of contiguous characters
or words) either forward through the file or backward through it.  To search for
the string means that you are trying to locate it somewhere in the file and have
ZMacs show you where the occurrences of the string exist.  This type of
search is somewhat different from what you may be familiar with.  It is a search
that is performed as you type in the thing to search for.  The command to
initiate a search is 1C-S* for forward search, and 1C-R* for reverse search.  BUT
WAIT!  Don't do them now.  When you type 1C-S* you'll notice that the string
"I-search" appears as a prompt in the echo area.  This tells you that ZMacs is in
what is called an 2incremental search* waiting for you to type the thing that
you want to search for.  1Altmode* terminates a search.

1>>*  Now type 1C-S* to start a search.  2Slowly*, one letter at a time, type the word
        1cursor*, pausing after you type each character to notice what happens to the
        cursor.

1>>*  Type 1C-S* to find the next occurrence of 1cursor*.

1>>*  Now type 1Rubout* four times and see how the cursor moves.

1>>*  Type 1Altmode* to terminate the search.

Did you see what happened?  ZMacs, in an incremental search, tries to go to
the occurrence of the string that you've typed out so far.  To go to the next
occurrence of 'cursor' just type 1C-S* again.  If no such occurrence exists ZMacs
beeps and tells you that it is a failing search.

If you are in the middle of an incremental search and type 1Rubout*, you'll notice
that the last character in the search string is erased and the search backs up to
the last place of the search.  For instance, suppose you currently have typed
1cu* and you see that your cursor is at the first occurrence of 1cu*.  If you now
type 1Rubout*, the 1u* on the search line is erased and you'll be repositioned in the
text to the occurrence of 1c* where the search took you before you typed the 1u*.
This provides a useful means for backing up while you are searching.

If you are in the middle of a search and happen to type a control character
(other than a 1C-S* or 1C-R*, which tell ZMacs to search for the next occurrence
of the string, or a 1C-Q*, which can be used to input certain 1Top* and 1Greek*
characters for compatibility with certain other systems), the search is
terminated, and the character is executed.  1Abort* will simply end the search, like
1Altmode*.

The 1C-S* starts a search that looks for any occurrence of the search string
2after* the current cursor position.  But what if you want to search for
something earlier in the text?  To do this, type 1C-R* for Reverse search.
Everything that applies to 1C-S* applies to 1C-R* except that the direction of the
search is reversed.


2GETTING MORE HELP*

In this tutorial we have tried to supply just enough information to
get you started using ZMacs.  There is so much available in ZMacs that
it would be impossible to explain it all here.  However, you may want
to learn more about ZMacs since it has numerous desirable features
that you don't know about yet.  ZMacs has a great deal of internal
documentation.  All of these commands can be accessed through the 1Help*
character.

To use the 2Help* features, type 1Help*, and then a character saying what kind of
help you want.  If you are 2really* lost, type 1Help* 1Help* and ZMacs will tell you
what kinds of help it can give.  If you have typed the 1Help* character and decide
you don't want any help, just type 1Abort* to abort.

The most basic Help feature is 1Help* C.  Type 1Help*, a 1C*, and a command
character, and ZMacs prints a description of the command.  When you are
finished reading it, type a 1Space* or an= 1Abort** to bring your text back on the
screen.

>>      Type 1Help* 1C* 1Control-P*.  When you are finished reading the output,
        type a 1Space*.  The message should be something like
1    *
        Control-P is Up Real Line, implemented by COM-UP-REAL-LINE:
        Move up vertically to previous real line.
        Moves as far as possible horizontally toward the goal column for successive
        commands.

The "name of the function" is important for people who are customizing ZMacs.
It is what appears in the ZMacs Chart as the documentation for the command
character.  For now you can ignore it.

Multi-character commands such as 1C-X* 1C-F* are also allowed after 1Help* 1C*.

Here are some other useful 1Help* options:

   1Help* 1D*       Describe a function.  You type in the name of the
                function.  To see your text again when it is done,
                type a 1Space* or 1Abort*.

1>>*  Try typing 1Help* 1D Replace String*.  Then type a1 Space* when you are
        finished reading it.

   1Help* 1A*       Apropos.  Type in a keyword and ZMacs will list
                all the functions containing that keyword.  For some
                functions it will also list a one or two character
                command which has the same effect.

1>>*  Type 1Help* 1A File*.  You will see a list of all functions (1M-X* commands)
        with "file" in their names.  You will also see commands like 1C-X* 1C-F* and 1C-X*
        1C-S*, listed under the corresponding function names.  When it says "**MORE**"
        at the bottom of the screen, type a 1Space* to see the rest of the list, or
        1Abort* to abort the rest of the listing.


2CONCLUSION*

Remember, to exit, use the 1System* key.  (1System* 1Help* will tell you what system
commands are accepted.)  Make sure to save any files you need saved before
exiting.

Unfortunately, there is no ZMacs manual yet.  You may, however, find an
EMACS manual to be useful.  Most of the commands documented there also
work in ZMacs.

This tutorial is meant to be understandable to all new users, so if
you found something unclear, don't sit and blame yourself - complain!
