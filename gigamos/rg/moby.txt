;This file begun on 2/13/85.  The MOBY-ADDRESS scheme was conceived on 2/10/85.

;  The MOBY ADDRESS(c) Technique.

;BACKGROUND:
;  One of the most important characteristics of a computer system is its "address space".
;This basically determines how large a program can be run, and until now has been thought
;of as a hardware determined parameter.  For example, the address space of the LMI
;LAMBDA processor has been said to be 2**25. of 32. bit words, and this number is determined
;by the width of certain hardware data paths, the size of certain mapping memories, etc.
;Although there have been various attempts to run larger programs than the basic address space of
;the computer involved, they have usually proved (much) less than successful.
;"Overlaying", for example, is one well known graveyard.  The MOBY ADDRESS(c) technique
;is a fundamental advance which allows the logical address space (now identified
;as the MOBY space) to be decoupled from the underlying hardware address space
;(now identified as the LOCAL space.)  Once decoupled from hardware, only software considerations
;limit the size of the MOBY space.  The baseline scheme we consider here, for example,
;provides 57 bits of address.  The feasibility of such large address spaces makes fundamental
;differences possible in the way addresses are treated.  For example, with such a large address
;space it becomes possible to make every address which ever existed or will exist running LISP
;machine environment unique.  (For example, each time a machine was booted it might be assigned
;a 25 bit chunk of address space, which would never again be reused.)  This, in turn,
;makes it possible to implement pointers from any LISP machine's evironment directly to
;any other.  This has far reaching consequences for the possibility of employing multiple
;processors on a single problem in an effective manner and on the problem of "stable" storage,
;to name only two important practical problems.

;BASICS
;  Virtual memory systems are commonplace in current day computer systems.
;Virtual memory systems evolved in response to a need to run larger programs than the
;available amount of physical primary memory (referred to as core memory).
;With a virtual memory system, a large amount of core memory can be simulated by the
;combination of a smaller amount of core memory plus a large backing store (usually a disk).
;This disk need not possess truly random access capability, and typically has a cost per bit
;several orders of magnitude less than core memory.   Basically, the image to be run
;is maintained on the disk, but parts that are actually active are "swapped-in" to core.
;The amount of core available affects only the number of swaps (and thus the time) necessary
;to run a given program; the ultimate answer will always be the same as if
;the entire amount of physical core had existed (ignoring time-dependancies etc.)
;A virtual memory system, then, decouples the virtual address space
;from the physical address space. However virtual addresses are still dealt with directly
;by hardware, and thus their sizes are limited by the width of certain hardware data paths.
; In the usual virtual memory system, the data on disk is maintained in exactly the same format
;as the format in which it is used in core.  Thus, swapping operations consist merely of
;transferring data from core to disk or vice versa.
; A MOBY ADDRESS(c) system operates similarily, with a key difference.  The data format on disk
;is not the same as the data format in core.  In core, data with hardware determined
;pointer widths, etc, exists exactly as usual.  These addresses are now identified as LOCAL
;addresses.  On disk, however, the data storage form is different, not a simple image of that
;used in core.  For example, two 32-bit words on disk might be used to represent each 32 bit
;word which exists in core.  This, then, allows a larger pointer width, if desired.  The baseline
;scheme presented here, used with usual LAMBDA storage conventions, allows a total MOBY ADDRESS(c)
;pointer width of 25.+32. equals 57. bits.  Note that during this format conversion,
;it is necessary to distinguish pointer data (which should be converted) from non-pointer
;data (numbers, strings, etc) which must not be affected.  This is possible on a tagged
;machine (such as a LISP machine), but not easily possible on a conventional computer.
;  For concreteness we assume the LOCAL address
;space is 2**25 and the MOBY space 2**57 although, of course, other sizes are possible.
;Also, for concreteness, we will refer to the values of other parameters of the LMI Lambda
;system, such the page size of 2**8, where appropriate.

;RECONCILATION
;  Swapping operations in a MOBY ADDRESS(c) system are not quite as simple as in a
;straightforward virtual address system.  To effect a swapin, the MOBY ADDRESSes present on disk
;must be converted to LOCAL addresses, a process referred to as RECONCILATION.
;Similarily, a swapout involves the conversion of LOCAL addresses to MOBY ADDRESSes, which
;is called DERECONCILATION.  To implement reconcilation and dereconcilation efficiently, the
;system maintains data structures, which associate, perhaps on a per page basis, each LOCAL page
;with its current MOBY page.  Since there are many more MOBY pages than LOCAL pages,
;each MOBY-LOCAL association must be in some sense transitory.

; A MOBY ADDRESS system must eventually provide for recycling of LOCAL addresses.  Consider a
;program which scans through 2**26 words.  After 2**25 words have been swapped in, all
;LOCAL addresses have been associated with MOBY addresses and the process can not go
;forward unless some LOCAL addresses are recycled.
;  However, practically speaking, a lot of address space can be touched before recycling
;is necessary. The MOBY recycling limit is a bit "farther away" in some sense than
;the conventional garbage collector limit in that the full 2**25 local addresses space
;can be used before it is absolutely necessary to face the recycling problem.

; $69 Question: when is it safe to recycle a LOCAL address and how is the system to know
;this in practice?

; Answer: It is safe to recycle a LOCAL address page and use it to swap in a different MOBY page
;  if and only if there are no LOCAL pointers to that page in existance.  Note that LOCAL
;  pointers on the page itself should not be counted.

;  One way to determine how many LOCAL pointers point to each LOCAL page without special hardware
;is to make a COUNT pass over the entire LOCAL data structure.  In a typical
;practical system, this would result in a noticable, but probably not intolerable delay,
;particularily if the entire LOCAL database is retained in physical core memory
;(in a IMPURE MOBY scheme we consider below, it might not be).  A system with 1 million words
;of core might COUNT in about 1 to 5 seconds, for example.
;  With special hardware (which might well be developed and patented by LMI), these counts
;could be maintained incrementally by hardware with essentially no system slowdown.
;(The optimization of not counting pointers to their own page could also be dealt
;with by hardware).

;Incremental Reconcilation
; For various reasons, it is advantageous to allow the reconcilation process to be
;incremental, instead of requiring an entire MOBY page be reconciled to a LOCAL page
;immediately when it is swapped in.  To implement this, the individual Qs on the LOCAL
;page which have not yet been reconciled are filled in with DTP-UNRECONCILED data type.
;DTP-UNRECONCILED pointers are never allowed to enter "the machine".  When an attempt
;is made to bring a DTP-UNRECONCILED pointer into the machine, an immediate trap occurs
;and that pointer is RECONCILED before further computation can proceed.
; DTP-UNRECONCILED pointers can also be used in conjunction with DERECONCILATION.
;Any typed Q in LOCAL memory can be changed to a DTP-UNRECONCILED pointer
;whenever desired. (Of course, if the page involved is writeable and has been written,
;the corresponding MOBY Q must be updated with the DERECONCILED LOCAL pointer).
;If any attempt is made to use such a pointer, a trap will occur and it will be RECONCILED again.

;  When all available LOCAL space has been associated with MOBY space,
;it possible that no LOCAL pages with zero reference counts will exist to recycle.
;  In such a situation, the system must DERECONCILE some LOCAL pointers and try again
;in the hope that the LOCAL reference count of some LOCAL page has been reduced to zero.
;In a LOCAL address space of 2**25, there are 2**17 pages.  If all have a non-zero pointer count
;there must be at least 2**17 pointers to them, which would occupy at least 2**9 pages.
;  So in the extreme worst case, operating blindly, it might be necessary to DERECONCILE
;almost everything except 2**9 pages worth before the LOCAL reference count of any page
;was reduced to 0. However, typical cases are expected to be far, far better than this.

;  This worst case situation can be greatly improved by a selective DERECONCILE.
;After a COUNT pass, (or at any desired time if incremental COUNT hardware is available),
;histogram the per page reference count data.  N free local pages can be obtained in one
;DERECONCILE sweep of the LOCAL data structure as follows: Set a threshold by consulting
;the cumulative page reference data from the histogram.  During the sweep, any reference
;to a page with fewer references to it than this threshold would be DERECONCILED.
;No pages would actually be swapped out, except the desired N, however, so at completion
;of the sweep the system would retain 2**17-N pages of immediately usable LOCAL data.
;  Such a selective DERECONCILE could itself be done on an incremental basis if
;COUNT hardware is available.  A background process (or processor) could simply scan LOCAL space.
;As each pointer is passed, if it points to a LOCAL page with a suitably low reference count
;(and perhaps meeting other conditions), that pointer is DERECONCILED.  If this reduces
;the LOCAL reference count of the page to 0, the page is put back on the available list.
;Prior to actually recycling a LOCAL page (which could result in that MOBY address eventually
;getting swapped in to a different LOCAL page), the state of the central processor must be
;"dumpped out", which then assures that the reference counts are completely accurate.
;(The reference counts normally count only pointers contained in core memory, not those
;contained within "the machine".)

;The MOBY cache.
;  It is likely a good idea to keep a cache of recently processed pages, represented in MOBY form.
;They are then available to the incremental reconcilation process, etc.  Also, if the
;pages involved are writable, they may be needed for updating during the DERECONCILATION process.

;The Keeper
;  When a MOBY pointer is referenced, the storage being referenced might exist on any
;Lisp machine! Likely, various databases and servers would exist to aid in determining which
;machine was the "KEEPER" of the desired data.  For simplicity, we assume there is exactly
;one KEEPER of any given address, although one can imagine schemes where, for redundancy
;or other reasons, this is not true. The KEEPER is defined to be that machine which normally
;stores the given data on its disk.  Such data
;can be "checked out" by other machines, and each KEEPER maintains records of who has checked out
;what data that this KEEPER is keeping.   Each machine which checks out data also keeps records of
;what data has been checked out from which machines.  In the event a machine crashes, it sends out
;a wakeup message when it reboots.  This invokes recovery proceedures to assure global data base
;consistancy.

;access patterns.
;  The process of RECONCILEing a large program which was KEPT on a remote server might
;involve excessive latency as messages are sent back and forth, etc.  To improve this situation,
;it might be advisable to transfersections in bulk slightly ahead of the actual need.
; Eventually, a fancy adaptive system might optimize
;this, recognizing a reference pattern and predicting future references.
;(This sort of live data is very hard to accumulate and use effectively in present systems.)

;multiprocessor issues:
;  We consider the case of several processors, each with its own LOCAL space, working
;off the same MOBY space.  The basic pointer mechanism works nicely, however, we still face
;the problem of assuring consistancy of the same MOBY location as seen by several processors.
;  The first important case is that of READ-ONLY data.  There is clearly no problem with
;read-only data, and this points out the importance on identifing all READ-ONLY data as
;such to the system.  Read-only data is duplicated by each processor into LOCAL space,
;as necessary.
;  With read-write data, the KEEPER maintains maintains a record of which other computers
;have or may have "checked-out" the section, page or Q invovled.

; WRITABLE data can be divided in four types, uniquely represented, automatically interlocked,
;manually interlocked and unsafe.

; Uniquely represented data is represented by a single current copy.  It can be safely modified
;    by whoever possesses it without further ado.  However, means must be provided
;    for the normal "keeper" of the data to remember who, if anyone, has checked-out
;    the official copy.   One who checks out data must be prepared to respond to a
;    disgorge message (instructing him to send either return the official copy to
;    the KEEPER or send it to a third party.).  The disgorge operation is implemented
;    by DERECONCILING the data in the local environment.

; Automatically interlocked data is used where writes are possible, but rare.  The data
;  is duplicated as with read only, and all users must maintain it in a read-only mode.
;  If a write should occur, a fault will be taken.  That user must exchage confirmation
;  with all other users who have checked out the data before a modification is allowed.
;  In case two users attempt to modify the data simultaneously, it is important only that
;  all copies of the data get updated consistantly.  This can be arranged..

; Manually interlocked data allows writes to proceed with minimal delay to the process
;  doing the write.  The data is set up read-only in the hardware.  If a write
;  happens, advisory messages are sent to other checked-out users.  However, since the
;  writing process is not delayed, it is possible that another machine could read the old
;  data even well after the write has been completed in the writing machine and program
;  execution proceeded.  A primitive ASSURE-MOBY-CONSISTANCY is provided, which waits
;  for advisory messages.   After this returns, all reads done by any machine must see
;  the new data.

; unsafe
;  ignores the problem.  User can send a "Here's what I think this data is" at any time,
;    if someone pipes up and disagrees, they can argue it out.


;WRITE-ONCE address space.
;  Has the property that it can be CONSed in, but never thereafter modified.
;It is a valuable resource for dealing with data bases which are built by multiple processors
;simultaneously without excessive locking delays.

;Note that the uniqueness of the MOBY addresses allows many simple operations to be
; efficiently performed in the KEEPER (either directly on the MOBY database or
; LOCALizing it).   For example, a request to do a LISP GET can be sent
; across the ethernet as three moby-addresses (an operation and two arguments).
; the reply is a single MOBY-ADDRESS, etc.


;SECTIONS
;  A SECTION is a group of MOBY pages, which occupies one or more contiguous ranges of
;MOBY address space.  (Typically, though, we visualize a SECTION as occupying only a few
;such ranges if more than one.  At some point, the SECTION would be recopied and compacted
;into a small number of ranges if it became excessively fragmented.)
;  SECTIONS serve a role in reducing the size of data bases necessary to effect
;RECONCILATION and DERECONCILATION.  Perhaps more importantly, SECTIONS provide a mechanism
;to control the "globality" of the MOBY address space.  For example, it would not really
;do to have every process in the universe sharing a single copy of the LISP atom NIL,
;because what happens if somebody clobbers it?   Similarily, if a machine crashes
;at an arbitrary time, assuring that the global data base is again consistant presents
;non-trivial difficulties.
;  SECTIONS are a mechanism for beginning to deal with such problems.  One primary idea is
;that a SECTION can have a COPY-ON-WRITE attribute.   Thus each processor can map in and use
;the base section, but if any write operation occurs, the prime copy is not modified.
;Instead, a MAPPED SECTION arises (as distinguished from the original section which is
;called a DIRECT SECTION) which consists of new copies of any pages that have been modified
;plus the original pages where they have not been modified.  The MAPPED SECTION continues
;to occupy the same MOBY ADDRESS space as the original (plus more perhaps, if it has
;grown larger).   To keep track of these copies, we introduce the idea of ENVIRONMENTs,
;discussed further below.  In brief, the current ENVIRONMENT specifies which copy of each
;known SECTION is actually in use at a given time by a given processor, plus information
;which controls the selection of active copies of other SECTIONs which may become known.
;  A SECTION has a human sensible name, and can appear in directories, be deleted, etc.
;In this way, a section is somewhat similar to a conventional FILE.  SECTIONS also
;have some similarity to LISP machine AREAs, in that a CONS operation in MOBY space occurs
;with respect to a SECTION.

;RECONCILATION and DERECONCILATION with SECTIONS.
;  Using SECTIONs, the operations of RECONCILATION and DERECONCILATION can be considered
;in two phases.  First there is the SECTION level ASSOCIATE operation which assigns an
;appropriately sized hunk of LOCAL address space to the MOBY address space of the particular
;SECTION.  Individual pages are then processed in either direction as called for.
;  By making ASSOCIATE entires at the SECTION level in the RECONCILATION data base, its size is
;greatly reduced.  (However, we still provide for PAGE and Q entries under the section
;entry in some circumstances).

;  Using SECTION based LOCAL - MOBY ASSOCIATIONs implies that the reference counts,
;mentioned above, might really be kept on a SECTION basis rather than the per page
;basis previously described.   Similarily, the smart DERECONCILE mentioned above
;could work on the basis of SECTIONS.  The system would identify a set of SECTIONs to
;be purged from LOCAL space, primarily, perhaps, on the basis of the reference counts
;incrementally maintained by special hardware.   Once a decision had been made to
;DEASSOCIATE some particular set of SECTIONs, a scan of the LOCAL data base would be
;initiated.  Any pointer to a SECTION to be DEASSOCIATED would be DERECONCILED.
;Once the LOCAL reference count of a given SECTION has been reduced to zero,
;the DISASSOCIATION can safely take place.  Note that this DISASSOCIATION process
;is well suited to being performed by a small auxillary processor so as to avoid
;interference with the main processor, although it could also be done by a background
;process on the main processor.

;As a sidelight, note that
;  structures in MOBY space which overlap page boundaries must be treated contiguously in
;LOCAL space.  So it may be advisable in some cases to minimize the extent to which
;structures cross page boundaries.  In practice, though, MOBY-LOCAL page associations are
;likely to be established in larger units than single pages, SECTIONS as described above.
;In such a case there would be no additional penality attached to a structure which overlapped
;a page boundary as long as it was contained entirely within its SECTION.


;DYNAMIC RECONCILATION.
;    The above discussion of SECTIONS illustrates how  multiple versions of a SECTION
;can exist at the same time and still all be "linked in".  (In effect, the multiple versions
;share the address space, but not the data).  In DYNAMIC RECONCILATION, another scheme,
;the local pointer corresponding to a MOBY address is produced by the result of a
;LOCAL function call.  The data in MOBY form, then, consists of a function to call
;and arguments.  This might be used for linking LISP SYMBOLS, although there
;are other options available for this as well.

;PURE versus IMPURE MOBY systems.
;The MOBY ADDRESS(c) system has been introduced in PURE form, that is, every
;LOCAL address is always necessarily associated with a MOBY address (from which it has
;been swapped in).  It is also possible to have an IMPURE MOBY ADDRESS(c) system,
;in which some LOCAL address have no associated MOBY address (or at least no
;non-transitory MOBY address).  If fact, such systems are of great practical interest
;such as the case where a LISP machine is booted as usual, then asked to "JOIN"
;the MOBY environment.  Some problems, however, arise in this process.

;RECONCILATION with an existing local address space.

;LIST structure in the MOBY space.
; Lists are typically composed of other lists, strings, numbers, and symbols.
; LISTs themselves, strings and numbers in the MOBY space present no particular problems.
;   Symbols, tho, are another story.

;LISP symbols
; The most important thing about a LISP symbol is its unique run-time identity or address.
; Symbols also have PRINT-NAMES, VALUE-CELLs, FUNCTION-CELLs, PACKAGE-CELLS, and
;  PROPERTY-LISTS.  VALUE-CELLS cells may be quite write-volatile, although the
;  SYSTEM-CONSTANT, and DEFCONST special cases are also important.  FUNCTION-CELLs
;  are rarely, but occasionally written.  The PLIST presents a special problem in that
;  not only is the PLIST cell potentially volatile, but the entire LIST is subject
;  to WRITE operations of PUTPROP, etc.  Also, GET is very frequently used, and it
;  may be quite unacceptable to send network messages, etc, for every GET even if that
;  would work.

;In a IMPURE moby environment, a SYMBOL may not have its unique run-time idenity in quite
;  the same way.  One problem comes if the "same" symbol already exists
;  both LOCAL and MOBY environments at the time a machine JOINs.  (By same we
;  mean as identified by some process having to do with READTABLEs and PACKAGEs,
;  not sharing a MOBY address).  We could "solve" the identity problem by making
;  special entries in the RECONCILE/DERECONCILE data bases, but that would still leave
;  the difficulty that symbol in the two spaces would not necessarily share the same PLISTs, etc.

;MOBY-SYMBOLS, a new sort, truly exist in the MOBY environment.  They can never
;  exist in the decoupled part of a LOCAL environment, thus, they are completely "different"
;  from any symbol we have now.  The information associated with a MOBY symbol
;  includes detailed instructions for how the individual writable locations of the
;  symbol are to be handled (re the writable options supported by the MOBY system
;  discussed above).  MOBY-SYMBOLS do not have property-lists per se, altho GET, PUTPROP
;  can still be used. (PLIST, however, is not permitted).  Write options can be
;  individually specified for the ASSOCIATION cell of each possible PLIST key.

;What are we trying to do with symbols?
;  One of the benchmark tasks for the MOBY system is recompile a large system
;using several processors simultaneously and effectively to do the job.
;Compilation is an elaborate transformation on lists, which is critically dependant
;on the properties of symbols.  (Notably, the VALUE-CELLs, FUNCTION-CELLs, and PROPERTY-LISTs
;thereof.)  We are not, however, proposing that the system's S-expression be read directly
;into MOBY space and the various machines sicced on various pieces thereof.
; Instead, the system is specified by a DEFSYSTEM, as now, (hopefully better than now),
;consists of various FILES, some of which are DEFs files, exactly as now.  It is the
;programmers responsibility to assure each file will compile properly in an environment
;consisting of the previous DEFs files, in effect.  Thus, we need only assure
;the appropriate DEFs files get read into each environment, etc.  MOBY-symbols are not
;involved.

;Even with MOBY symbols, we must have LOCAL-ENVIRONMENT options.  That is,
; we cannot permit any program to break the entire MOBY enviroment by clobbering
; a critical property, etc.  Additionally, we must allow for long term system evolution,
; change of data formats, etc.  Furthermore, any MOBY-ROOT structures must be carefully
; designed to avoid bottlenecks as they are accessed by many machines simultaneously, etc.

;The MOBY-ROOT.  We allocate a fixed number (randomly 1024 for now)
; of ROOT-ENVIRONMENTS.  The allocation of a
; new one is an exceedingly rare event (corresponding to major system revisions, etc,
; or an absolute maximum of one per day (ha ha)).  Vectors to ROOT-EVIRONMENTS
; are stored in the first 1024 positions of ROOT-SPACE.

;ENVIRONMENTS.
;  An environment is a group of pages which can be "inherited".  Each process
;has a current environent list.  The key point is, no environment, except possibly
;the first, is ever actually modified.  A MOBY-ROOT, for example, is only "read-into"
;by certain exceedlingly privledged processes (and typically never, once it is initialized).
;Normally if a write occurs to a page in the MOBY root, the write is allowed to
;proceed.  However, the MOBY-ROOT is not modified!.  Instead, the modified page now becomes
;part of another environment on the current-environment list of the running process.

;All processes with the same identical environment list "see" the same identical MOBY
;symbols.  Processes with differing environments, may not.  If they share the same
;ROOT environment, however, symbols in that ROOT will be EQ even though they may not
;have the same contents in their VALUE-CELLs, etc!

;MOBY PACKAGES.
;  Serve an analogous function for MOBY symbols as normal packages in the LISP machine system
;serve for normal symbols.

;for now, an environment list will be associated with a processor, not exactly a process.

;all it takes to join is some LOCAL pages.

;local versus non-local environments.

;non-local evironments can be shared by several machines.

******* 5/20/85

We propose to identify each active moby section with an AREA.  To do this,
a few extra bits need to be added.

  A bit associated with the BITS of the AREA says its a MOBY-AREA.
    Attempts to create new regions in such area give REGION-OVERFLOW trap
    to macrocode.

  %make-region (which is not now used) is respecified.
    (%make-region area size bits)

  (%wipe-region  high-data low-data words)  wipes the region from current free pointer
    to that data and sets the free-pointer.

  A bit associated with each region which inhibits CONSing in that region.
   used for MOBY-REGIONs which may not appear full yet are not suitable for CONSing.
