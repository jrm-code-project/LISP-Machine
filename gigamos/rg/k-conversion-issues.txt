stack frame format issues and goals:

overall:
(1)     The "simple" case should use just the hardware provided features.
        It is very highly desirable not to impinge at all on the code
        sequence, although a tiny bit of compromise might be acceptable.

(2)     the stack frame format must provide for all the features of common lisp
        including fluid variables, catch and throw, rest-args.

(3)     it must be possible to write a "reasonable" error handler.
        this means providing for.
          stack must be "decodable" by error handler.  In particular,
             if there are several stacks, it must be possible to
             correctly associated the various frames on the various stacks.
             For example, you must be able to tell (somehow) which variables
             on the special stack go with a main stack frame, etc.
             There error handler must be able to determine how many slots in
             each stack frame are in fact used for args.
          trap on exit
        In all cases having to do with the error handler, efficiency is not a prime
        concern.  So there may well be several different ways of handling things, it is
        only necessary that it works somehow.

(4)     upward lexical closures have to work.  This can get sticky since it may well involve
        linked lists of pointers at stack frames.  This may well mean that any frame involved
        in an upward funarg must be a "slow" case.  If an argument variable passed in the
        hardware is lexcially closed over, it is probably necessary to move the variable to
        a main memory location so it can be pointed at by the lexical stuff.

necessary or highly desirable for compatibility with old stuff:

(5)     deal with self map provided

maybe desirable for compatibility or other reasons.
(6)     ability to have ADI.  may not be necessary if all uses for it are handled by other means.


basic scheme:
  it looks like we need 3 stacks per stack group:

(1)  the hardware stack and a memory area for it to overflow/get-written-out into.
     this has 16 words per frame, always.

(2)  A special stack used for dynamic bindings.  Different from 3 because:
        (1)  some cases (fairly rare, but these absolutely have to work) involve variable numbers of bindings
        or bindings created after main frame has been entered while it is running.

        (2)  the stack-group swapping mechanism involves scanning this, traversing it in both
        directions.  It is highly desirable that the loop involved in doing this be as
        tight as possible (i.e. minimum figuring out and skipping over stuff that is not bindings).

(3)  an auxillary stack used in a large number of various (hopefully rare) cases.
        the following cases (at least) are candidates for "requiring a slow frame".

        (1) more that 16 (or maybe 15, etc)  args on call.
        (2) more than 16 (") combinded args and local variable which need to persist across call boundaries.
        (3) frame binds fluid variables
        (4) frame contains errorset type stuff
        (5) frame is lexically closed over  (needs to be capable of being pointed at, in some sense).

        (6) (maybe)
            frame is entered via a "computed function" (rather than directly statically linked).
            in this case we may well need a LP-FEF type word to keep track of what function
            we are trying to call.  Alternative might be to use just call hardware
            with LP-FEF word in a separate funny volatile register.  This might lead to non-optimal
            code or order-of-evaluation problems, however.

        (7) (maybe) frame returns multiple values.
        (8) (maybe) some cases involving &rest or &keyword args.


some points:
   lexical closed-over variables need to be on the aux-stack (because they need to be pointable at,
        i.e. referencable by %LOAD-FROM-HIGHER-CONTEXT, etc).  This causes a substantual
          slowdown compared to having them in the hardware stack (assuming they fit, etc).
     alternatives: (but it doesnt seem either of these win)
         (1)  leave 16 (or 15, etc) slots in aux stack for the hardware frame variables to be stored
          when the frame is not active. -- not clean tho because you have to make sure they are really there.
         (2)  be able to "dig out" hardware stack variables, starting from pointer to aux stack frame
          (or component thereof).  Slows down %LOAD-FROM-HIGHER-CONTEXT to check for this.  Form of pointer
          from aux-stack frame to hardware stack frame is unclear and would have to deal with the case
          hardware stack frame has been scrolled out.
