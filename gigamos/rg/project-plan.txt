Right Now

       Youceff -paging
        design paging and file interface clean enuf to port across hosts.
        implement for Lambda, MacII, and Silicon Graphics in that order.
       Naha - Stack dump reload
       Ed & Kent -   compiler, etc.
       Erric - package stuff.  Build cold and start loading files, etc.

    Question: With current compiler are there any CL major
        features remaining to be implemented?


       Rauen - Evaluator



Needed
      Loader need to know about package roots,
        code to initialize k with two package roots
      Lambda Cold load (erric)
      Flavors - one major piece of "new work" involved
         in the whole thing. (rg)
      low level display -done by youcef -
      Window System (rg also)
      Error Handling  stack format sensitive (?)
      Compatibility issues:   reimplement microcoded functions (minor)
                              decommitted functions (minor)
                              CDR-codes (minor)
                              ART-Q arrays  (either implement or decomit)

      Networking ...  (not immediately vital.  stuff on lambda will port).
      "Common-LISP" improvements  (ie that stuff which more or less works now)
        speed up loading
        Arithmetic, trig functions, etc

      GC


host application program:
        implements host side of swapping and file protocol above.
