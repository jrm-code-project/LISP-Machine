	 	The Multiple Package Root Feature.


	As it stands, Common Lisp only provides for a single heirarchy
of packages (or more precisely, a single "web" of them).  This can be a
significant limitation.  For example, it might be desirable to provide a
namespace fully compatible with existing software, while at the same
time having another namespace which is unconstrained and can be tailored
to new requirements.  Having two package roots is a clean way to
accomplish this.  This note describes the feature and discusses some
underlying concepts.

	The idea of a package root is in effect present in Common Lisp,
although it is not made explicit.  Since the user is free to specify
each link in the package "web", he is not constrained to make it
strictly "hierarchial" although it must be free of loops.  Nonetheless,
we may assume for practical purposes that there will always exist a
"GLOBAL" or "LISP" package which is inherited from all the others, and
which may be viewed as the ROOT of the package system.  (Actually, this
assumption is not critical to the implementation of the feature as
proposed here, it just simplifies discussing and thinking about it).

	Beyond simply allowing the user to specify a second completely
independant "web", there are several things important to the usability
of such a feature in practice.  In particular, it is important that the
logical "position" within the package web continue to be representable
in the value of a single variable.  In other words, binding the variable
*package* must "preserve the state", etc.  If this were not true,
PKG-BINDs as used in numerous places in the system would not funtion as
intended, and the modularity of multiple processes would be seriously
impared.  This implies that the ROOT must be implicitly contained within
the package structure, as opposed to being held in a separate
*PACKAGE-ROOT* variable or some such.  As long as each package is a
member of a single root structure, there is no logical difficulty in
having the root contained within the structure for the package.

	A lessor consideration is that it is desirable that all packages
in the system continue to be avaliable on the list *ALL-PACKAGES* and
that the format of *ALL-PACKAGES* continue to be a simple list.  If this
is true, certain system tools such as EDIT-CALLERs will continue to work
without change.

	The whole point of the MULTIPLE ROOT PACKAGE feature is to
transparently allow multiple namespaces to exist.  It follows that it
must be orthagonal to all existing package specifications, etc, and in
particular, must allow the same identical file to be loaded into several
package root webs without interactions.  Nonetheless, it is desirable to
be able to specify which package roots a given file is designed to load
into, whether it makes sense to try to compile the file in a particular
package root, etc.  These features are provided by means of several new
file-attribute-list keywords.

	Implementation:

	It was possible to implement the Multiple Package Root without
fundamental change to the existing Lisp Machine package system by
building upon the preexisting REFNAME-ALIST feature.  Briefly, the
REFNAME-ALIST feature allows a <package-name-as-typed> to
<actual-package-structure-referred-to> mapping for intern operations
against a particular package.  Providing top level functions to
appropriately generate the REFNAME-ALIST suffices to implement the
Multiple Package Root feature.  This implementation is somewhat
inelegant in that the length of these mapping lists grows with the
square of the number of packages under a particular root.  On the other
hand, this is philosiphically consistant with the rest of the Common
Lisp package system which employs individually specified links as
opposed to explicit tree structure, and the amount of storage "wasted"
is trivial in practical cases.

	Although the REFNAME-ALIST feature was pre-existing, it had not
really been employed for such "heavy duty" service as envisioned here.
Therefore, some cleanup and extensions were required.  A few compromises
had to be made for the sake of compatibility with existing programs
(particularily in the values of certain optional arguments if they are
not supplied), but these are minor compromises.
