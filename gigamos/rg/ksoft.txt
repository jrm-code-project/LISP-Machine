ISSUE FILE:
   This file has various sections:
  (1) POINT-COUNTERPOINT relevant to particular issues (indexed by issue),
  (2) THINGS THAT NEED TO GET DONE,
  (3) official current assignments of people to projects, etc
  (4) toy acquisition list and related issues.
  (5) longer term projects
  (6) general wish list
  (7) personal sections indexed by person (containing anything that person wishes).

   Anyone can add a new point to the POINT-COUNTERPOINT section, however, the management
reserves the right to order this section of the file.   Generally, we will try to have the
most important issues at the head of the file.
   Anyone can contribute to either the POINT OR COUNTERPOINT section of an item.  Normally
contributions should be signed, although that is optional.  It is probably best to
summarize central points in the POINT-COUNTERPOINT section; supporting information should
be included by reference to the person's section or other on-line files or documents
(off line documents can of course be referenced, but try to include enuf info so someone
reading this file can understand whats going on).
   A word on mechanics:  several people can be updating this file.  if the file has changed
since the last time your lisp machine referenced it, you will get a message "THE FILE DJ:RG;KSOFT has
changed since the last time you read or wrote it, etc, do you want to write it out anyway"
when you try to write out the file.  --Type NO--.  Then use <meta-x>SOURCE COMPARE MERGE to
combine things, then write it out.  SOURCE COMPARE MERGE should be fairly self explanatory.
If you walk up to a machine with this file in a buffer, it is probably a good idea to do a
<meta-x> REVERT BUFFER before beginning to save yourself work later.


point:
(rg):   We can implement a namespace fully compatible with the current LISPM while at the
        same time having another (or several other) namespaces which can do some new thing
        by means of the package-root feature.  [see the discussion in the file RG;multi-roots >.]
        We should proceed immediately to implement this.
        Primarily, this will involve a bit of work on the K-machine end of the loader.


POINT:
(efh):  It is desirable to have the core of the system implemented cleanly in COMMON LISP.
        any compatiblity packages (such as ZETALISP, old FLAVORs, etc) should be implemented on top of
        this core.

(khh):
    Most developers use only common lisp functions since they
    want to be portable to as many systems as possible. If the
    base software is this, then the optimized routines are the
    common lisp ones, and the zeta-lisp stuff is an add-on that
    can be removed easily to help developers ensure common lisp
    compatibility.

    Requires much smaller set of software to be written and/or
    ported for initial product ship (See KHH development plan
    Phase-I near the end of this file).

    Permits fastest introduction of a new product to the field,
    with future enhancements directly on the same development
    path.

    Opens up a new market area for a very fast end-user system
    for applications that don't require lisp programs to be
    re-written into C or similar kludges.

    VME system avoids hardware problems in NU machine, and helps
    prevent the K from being associated with problems in the
    lambda.



COUNTERPOINT:
(rg):  True, this is desirable.  However, we can reach this goal by evolutionary means
       replacing one file at a time etc.  Since this relates to an internal implementation detail
       it is not of primary importance to the customer.  From the company's point of view,
       attempting this objective directly may well subject us to an unacceptable transient
       period where we have no usable software whatever.  We should attempt to quantify
       how large this transient would be in any way we can.  Cogent arguments should also
       be advanced relevant to the difficulties of an incremental approach.
       Also, it is not clear what problems might be encountered with implementing
       a fully compatible flavors system without special hooks and what type of special hooks
       might be required.  One possibility is to reimplement old flavors in COMMON Loops,
       but the problems involved in that are not clear and COMMON Loops doesnt really exist yet.
       One thing we dont want to do is spend too much time rewriting the details of messy old
       flavors.

(rg):  Saying the Common Lisp frob is "on top" on the Zeta Lisp frob is really
       a figure of speech.  There is no necessary efficiency implication.  It is not true that
       everything "COMMON LISP"  "goes thru" anything Zeta Lisp, etc.

       Re speed of product introduction, that is a very important consideration which
       we should attempt to quantify one way or the other.  In particular, estimates of
       the size in source characters of new stuff which would have to be written are relevant.

       Re association with Lambda, we can do both and call it different things if you want.
       Symbolics and DEC both purposely generate confusion as to exactly which internal processor is
       is in which box, sometimes fooling their customers, usually fooling the media, and
       almost always fooling themselves.  Everybody's happy ha ha.

       Estimates of development times in KHHs personal section are interesting
       but need to be supported with breakdowns and details.

       The VME bus (any or all of KHH's three possibilities) may well represent a good alternative.
       However, even KHH's development path step 1 puts us at least 6 months away from having
       ANYTHING due to lack of core system software.  Anything having to do with external things
       (which configuration of VME bus, VME bus or NUBUS, etc) can be resolved in a maximum of
       three months (I believe).  Thus, we have a minimum of three months to concentrate
       on the core system software before it will be necessary to commit ourselves to
       one or more of the possibilities.

ANSWER:
(gjc)  The special hooks required to port FLAVOR.LISP to VAX-NIL were
       SI:MAKE-EXTEND <size> <class-or-flavor-object>
       hook in FUNCALL and APPLY
       hook in compiler and interpreter for an ATOMIC-MACRO kind of thing,
       (si:atomic-macrolet ((x (aref self (aref self-mapping 0)))
                            (y (aref self (aref self-mapping 1))))
         ... body ...)

       The "core" of the system should be in a subset of common lisp. Not heavily dependant
       on hairy aspects of the type system and generic functions. The core also needs to
       have error handling and debugging aspects that are not defined in common lisp.


POINT:
(khh):  We should NOT put the K into the Lambda.

        The Lambdas have picked up a reputation as unreliable. This perception
    would get carried over onto the K. Also there are still serious problems in
    the SDU and multibus boards. To put the K into it would require
    considerable work to fix these problems.

        Another reason that the K should not be retrofit in the lambdas is that
    there is no real marketing demand for it. Bill Wise called up about 70 of
    our customers and asked them what kind of a system they would be interested
    and suggested several of the possibilities under consideration. The result
    was that about 10% of these were interested in a retrofit option.
    Assuming that there are 250 systems installed, half of the systems are 2x2,
    and that only half the the people that acually indicated interest would
    actually buy, means a total market of about 15 processors. This is clearly
    not worth the development work.

    (NOTE- I've heard the results of this survey second hand, so it should be
     checked for accuracy. I did a estimate of the number of the processors
     that could be retrofitted using considerably more optimistic assumtions
     and the potential market still didn't justify the work.)

       Over the past week four different customers were asked what sort of a
    next generation system they would be interested in. The result was that 3 of these
    customers preferred some standard box such as the SUN (they listed several, the SUN
    was always one those mentioned). One customer had no preference between the two
    but thought that the sun would probably be cheaper and therefor preferable.


counterpoint:
(rg):   We should put the K (possibly with a different name if you really want) into the
        Lambda.

        Our customers have them and are doing fairly well in most cases.  I propose that
        NO work be done on any of the other boards such as SDU or any of the multibus boards.

        The basic reasons for doing it are:
        (1)  we are going to do it internally anyway.
             as our discussion has developed, we are not going to get our internal software done
             for at least 6 months (quite possibly a lot more for the path of redoing everything).
             Thus, our critical path is core system SOFTWARE SOFTWARE SOFTWARE.  Obviously
             we should proceed to do work on this using the environment currently available.
             When we begin to see light at the end of the development tunnel for the central system
             (I estimate maybe 3 months) then we should make our decision(s) about which box and bus.
             Until then, anything box or bus related is secondary, although some background work
             should continue.  In particular, sending out a VME processor layout (and making a couple)
             coincident with an updated NUBUS layout sounds like a reasonable idea.

        (2)  this may well enable us to sell a few lambda's on the promise they can eventually be
             upgraded.  However, we should clearly understand that future Lambda production
             represents a bridging mechanism to our future products which must be much cheaper,
             more reliable, easier to manufacture, etc etc.

        (3)  we owe it to our customers to provide them this option even if they dont take it.

        (4)  there is no argument whatsoever that standard boxes are preferable to kludgy special
             ones.  I agree completely and totally.  The question is which standard box (or maybe all,
             etc.)  As a point of relavent information, someone should find out which SUN box(es)
             would be suitable for a K upgrade.  The MAC-II is the box I really thing would be a super
             win, with IBM compatible and SUN following.  However, we should really be serious about
             looking at and (quite possibly) doing all of them.
POINT:
(rg)   We are going to have to move!  I like this neighborhood.
       One issue is whether we consolidate the company in one location.  If so, it would be
       in Cambridge.  However, right now it looks like Lowell will stay in Lowell for one year.
       If so, we probably need about 6000 sq ft, 18,000 if they move.

POINT:
(hlc)  If we do not consolidate the company's operations now, we will miss the chance to undo a serious error of
       the past. The continuing costs of maintaining two facilities include:
       -lack of one cohesive team
          -divergence into competing departments and special interests
       -communication inefficiencies
          -reduced ability to see how one's work supports company goals
          -reduced ability to discover how one's work might be helped by (or affect) what someone else is working on
          -extra effort to locate someone, which is a problem both for customers and employees
          -difficulty and cost of explaining over the phone or by fax what could be easily done in person
       -duplication of effort and resources
          -two receptionists, or, more likely, none in Cambridge
          -two purchasing, shipping & receiving functions
          -two kitchen, exercise, common room facilities
          -two phone systems to keep operational
          -two copiers, which cannot be alternated between if one is in use
       The main reason for not consolidating is that most Lowell employees are believed to strongly prefer
       remaining in that area. In addition,the quantifiable costs of consolidating include:
       -moving expenses (probably about $5000)
       -about a week of lost time per person (total about $50,000)
       -yearly rental differential ($10 per sq. ft. times 15,000 sq. ft. = $150,000 per year)

COUNTERPOINT:
(rg)   Quite right, but we have to convince the folks in Lowell.

POINT:
(hlc)  Now that a lease has been signed for space in Lowell, the Cambridge location can be selected primarily on
       the requirements of the K-machine and PICON groups.
       One preliminary proposal (submitted for costing only) for building out the second floor space at 1030 Mass
       includes the following items:
        -1350 sq. ft. computer room
        -combined kitchen/common room
        -shower
        -two small project areas surrounded by offices
        -one conference room

The following places have been suggested:  (feel free to add places or fill in information or comments about them)

1030 Mass ave  above Barsamian's (third floor probably, although there is a tag end on the second)
      new buildout.  would take several months to move in.
      Parking available, but cost $100 per month per space.
     -16,000 usable sq. ft. on third floor
     -5846 usable sq. ft. on the  second floor.
     -asking $24 per sq. ft., might agree to about $20
     -at least a 3 year lease

Symbolic's old space above Legal Seafood
     -17,000 sq. ft.
     -completely built out, available within 60 days
     -1800 sq. ft. computer room plus 1100 sq. ft. associated space includes 2 20-ton air conditioners, halon system
      patch panel with cables to most offices, temperature monitor, raised floor
     -probably not too expensive (under $20 per sq. ft.)
     -parking: 2 spaces per 1000 sq.ft., $105 per month indoors, $70 outdoors (across from Legal Seafood)
     -short term sublease (about one year) or optionally longer lease

University Park
        cheap, but frequently in lee of NECCO candy factory.
        does not appear to be ready.

Central Square Building (at prospect)
     -675 Mass Ave.
3 different possibilities:
    a floor in the tower:
        8000 sq ft.
        great views in all directions.
        would need fresh buildout.

    a floor in the "five-story" (probably the fifth, former executive offices for new england gas)
        8000 sq ft (? is this right henry?) (about 7500 usable sq. ft. -hlc)
        somewhat crufty, but probably sort of suitable for immediate movin without new buildout.
        a medium number of quite large rooms.  Probably eventually would subdivide most of them.
        has a couple of nice balconies.

    the "garden view".
        cheapest
        4000 sq ft with possible more cheap space in basement
        very high ceilings.  hard to divide into offices (unless some brilliant concept, etc)
        fairly close to computer room with UPS and diseal generator!

    some parking available under 5 story (before it gets taken, etc)
        otherwise across street, either on former Fisherman Bill's or in lot across Prospect st from that.

     -up to about 100,000 sq. ft. available. Floors in the tower portion have 8,000 to 9,000 sq. ft., great views
     -available now "as is", though repainting and new carpets would be helpful
     -approximately 1500 sq. ft. computer room available on second floor, includes raised floor, halon system,
      4 air conditioners (15 or 20 ton), temperature monitor
     -asking $23 per sq. ft. including extensive rebuildout, negotiably less "as is"
     -parking is in nearby outdoor lots, could be a problem
     -renovation of Central Square might cause noise and traffic problems

Orion research
        mumble

POINT:
(bob):  As far as I can see, the new LMI has five different products.
        These are:

        1. lambda-support
        2. lambda-manufacturing
        3. the K-machine project
        4. PICON
        5. IKE

        Each product needs to have money spent on it if it is to be sold.
        However, we have only a finite amount of money;  this means
        that money spent on one product must be taken away from
        another.  For example, $20,000 spent on IKE is $20,000 taken
        away from the K-machine project.

        I am looking to get some sense of how best to spend the money
        we have.  Should we cancel PICON, for example, and put the
        money into the K-machine; or should we cancel IKE?  Or should
        we take $60,000 from the K-machine project to bring IKE up to
        snuff?  Could we expect, thereby, to sell 12 copies of IKE and
        double our money within a year?

        I think the best way to get some sense of how to allocate
        people's time and Guy's money is to draw up a series of
        business plans, one for each product.  I know full well that
        business plans have a bad reputation at LMI.  In the past,
        around here, business plans have been fantasies, and have been
        used to mislead rather than inform.  However, we do not have
        to produce fantasies if we choose not to.  We do not need to
        be unnumerate fools who claim that they can make predictions
        to six significant figures when they are just guessing.
        Instead, we can try to be sensible.

        A plan is a sketch map of the territory we expect to enter.
        It is a way of looking ahead at problems and prospects.  In
        addition, a business plan should contain milestones that we
        can use to determine whether a product is succeeding or
        failing.  It is evident that the old LMI never had milestones
        that anyone took seriously (there were lots of pretend
        milestones that were part of the $40 million fantasy
        extravaganza).  When you don't have milestones to take
        seriously, you are like the operator of a nuclear power plant
        who does not have instruments.  You don't know how you are
        doing, until it is too late.

        Take PICON as an example: the critical milestone that RG has
        suggested is that the PICON project should begin to pay for
        itself on the first of January 1988.  This means we would have
        to sell copies of PICON at a faster rate than we have ever
        sold them before--and sell them in a market where PICON is not
        the only real-time expert system.

        Is the January milestone realistic or is it a fantasy?  What
        do we need to find out to make a judgement?  If we think that
        January is a good date to break even, what do we have to do to
        make a success of it?  Do we need to find customers or will
        they come to us?  Do our old customers tell us that they will
        buy second and third copies of PICON in sufficient quantity to
        break even?  What do they tell us we need to do for them to
        buy copies of PICON?  Once we have told them of the new PICON
        and the new LMI, how long does it take before they send in the
        orders?

        It is generally agreed that PICON needs to be ported to a
        non-Lisp Machine in order to sell; this will cost.  In
        addition, PICON will probably need several enhancements.  The
        list includes generic rules, multiple component moves, an icon
        editor, automatic rule generation, sequential timed actions,
        help facilities, rapid redisplay of large knowledge bases, and
        industry standard icon libraries (including dashed lines for
        wire connections).  How important are these different
        enhancements and how difficult are they?  Which really are
        necessary and what resources are needed to implement them?

        Let me put these questions another way: should we take
        one-half million dollars out of the K-machine project and put
        it into PICON development; or should we put the money into
        Lamda manufacturing instead?  Or should the money all go to
        K-machine development?

COUNTERPOINT:
(rg):   We are not in a position to consider these questions in detail now
        since we have too many other things to worry about.  Our working
        assumption is that we will take 6 months to rebuild the company, etc.
        Of course, over the long haul each company activity will have to justify
        itself.  In particular, my general feeling is that after 6 months it should
        more or less be "sink or swim."  That is, all projects should either be
        visibly swimming (i.e. making money) or CLEARLY financable (i.e. product is
        in beta test, shipments will start soon, etc).

(COUNTER^2)POINT:
(bob):  If "we have too many other things to worry about" we don't have
        the time or the ability to spend a half million dollars in the
        next 6 months.  What I am afraid is that we will waste money
        when we don't need to.

        RG says that his "...general feeling is that after 6 months it
        should more or less be `sink or swim.'"  One possiblilty is to
        port PICON to the VAX and RTIME to the AT.  This, in itself,
        is a good idea.  However, PICON will, in this plan, be very
        similar to the PICON that Lowell Hawkinson left behind last
        September.  You will still have to buy a Lisp machine from
        some company to use PICON (only the run time version will go
        on the VAX).  In the summer of 1986 we used to say that PICON
        was a year ahead of the competition.  I think that was true.
        A good portion of that year has now been lost.  In the next
        few months we have to build PICON so that it can sell against
        the competition of 1988.  I don't think we can do it with the
        PICON of 1986.

        RG says that "Our working assumption is that we will take 6
        months to rebuild the company, etc."  What I am talking about
        *is* rebuilding the company.  A company has to do several
        things to survive.  In our case, we not only have to produce
        hardware and software, we have to tell people about it and
        persuade some people to buy it.  Just creating hardware and
        software is not enough.  It is not `rebuilding the company';
        it is half-building the company, walls without a roof.

        Based on conversations I have had with customers, I do not
        think that we will be able to sell PICONs at a rate of 36 per
        year starting in January 1988 unless we pursue a vigorous
        development policy and have the infrastructure needed to
        support the product.  Otherwise, I think that OEMs (our
        preferred customers) will see us as slow moving
        might-have-beens.  Against that fate, this time around, I would
        like to see us be a success.


(COUNTER^3)POINT:
(rg):   (Counter^2) point is not to the point!  If you are saying we should
        seriously consider cancelling picon, say that directly.  At the moment,
        I perceive enough interest in the customer base to definitively rule
        out that possibility for the short term.  If all our customers go away,
        then that is something else, etc.  The key for PICON is repeat sales.
        We have several customers who could potentially put us in gravy for years
        all by themselves (TEXACO, Proctor and Gamble, etc).  Our challenge is
        to turn them into ACTUAL repeat customers.  I would prefer to see us
        concentrate directly on what is required to achieve this rather than
        the more nebulous considerations brought forth in (POINT:).

(COUNTER^4)POINT:
(bob):  I do not understand what you mean when you say that

        "(Counter^2) point is not to the point!  If you are saying we
        should seriously consider cancelling picon, say that
        directly."

        I have already said that directly, in the third paragraph of
        (POINT).  I think that if we put insufficient resources into
        PICON, the Process Systems will not generate enough revenue to
        break even on 1 January 1988.  If we expect PICON to fail,
        then I think we should cancel the project.

        Perhaps we expect PICON to succeed.  In that case, we will
        want to attempt to select the amount of funding for PICON that
        will maximize the rate of return for PICON.  Obviously, we
        cannot make exact predictions--we all know that "it is very
        difficult to make predictions, especially about the future".
        However, every action we take, whether to cancel PICON or give
        it one level of funding or another level of funding, is based
        on either an implicit prediction or an explicit prediction.

        My argument is that since we are going to act according to
        some prediction, we should make it explicit and examine it
        rather than leave it implicit and unexamined.  This applies
        not only to PICON but to the four other products we have, too.

        I have seen claims, but have not seen any arguments or
        evidence justifying the claim, that we will be able to make
        repeat sales to Texaco and P&G at a rate of 36 copies of PICON
        per year if we offer them the following package:

            -- current version of PICON running on a Lambda, Explorer or 3600
            -- improved RTIME running on the AT
            -- runtime only version of PICON on the VAX

        I am making the claim (but am not offering evidence) that to
        make repeat sales at that rate, we will have to offer all that
        and that in addition we will have to offer:

            --> evidence of very high reliability for the hardware
            --> evidence of very high reliability for the software
            --> a scheduled, believeable enhancement path including
                at least some of the following features:

                a. generic rules
                b. multiple component moves
                c. an icon editor
                d. automatic rule generation
                e. sequential timed actions
                f. help facilities
                g. rapid redisplay of large knowledge bases
                h. industry standard icon libraries
                   (including dashed lines for wire connections).
                i. model based inferencing
                j. easy to use explanation facilities
                k. schematic based diagnostics (Mark Kramer)
                l. dynamically created icons
                m. operator query and answer

            (This list is just for the example; I have a longer list on line.)

        In brief, I am arguing that we will be taking positions on all
        the points I have just mentioned (as well as similar points
        regarding Lambda manufacturing, Lambda support, K-machine
        development and the IKE project).  The positions we take can
        either be implicit or explicit, unexamined or examined.  I am
        proposing that we examine our positions; and am looking to get
        some sense of how best to spend the money we have.

        Here are a few other specific items that I think we should
        consider now rather than six months from now:

        1. Should we take $60k from the K-machine project and use the
        money to further IKE development in the next 6 months?

        2. How many potential customers really will want a full scale
        Zetalisp development environment on the K-machine.

        3. How many will not buy the K-machine unless it has Zetalisp?

(counter^5)pointer:
rg:     I see no evidence that the 60K would make the difference between a viable
        and a non-viable picon group 6 months from now.  Furthermore, I cannot imagine
        how such evidence could possibly be convincing.  The charter of the
        Process Systems Group is to take the given resources (ie 9 slots, etc)
        and have a viable group in 6 months.   (Of course, more slots can be
        had if they are specifically funded by contracts with customers, etc)

what is "COMMON lisp"?
  procedural stuff


what is ZETA lisp?
  (very slightly) different procedural stuff.
  flavors
  window system
  ZWEI


What is necessary to make old flavors and the window system run?

Do we "have" common lisp now?  YES of course.

what is the standards picture?
    common lisp:   pretty much available, although numerous details still being hassled.
    common loops:  first draft of "final draft" will probably be available soon.
    window system based on common loops:  not started yet
    standard window system based on common loops:  totally off in the future.
    other window systems:
        intellicorp
        sun news
        xwindows
        microsoft windows


what is minimum software to be deliverable?
   do we need to run LAMBDA code?

   do we need a window system?

  Recommended Development Path
    The following subsections describe the recommended
    development path for the K. The sections 1-4 are meant to be
    implemented in the order listed.

    1. Windowless K processor on VMEBUS with Sun UNIX
       a) Description
          Put the K processor on the VMEBUS and install it in a Sun
          workstation. The K runs a COMPLETE COMMON-LISP system but
          has no window system support. All communication with the Sun
          is through streams to a unix program, or to/from a file.
          This provides the K in a usable delivery system
          configuration. All the performance of the K is available.
          This version of the machine is the quickest to bring to
          market since it doesn't require flavors, a window system,
          ZMACS, etc. If desired this configuration could easily be
          made without use of any of the MIT code since nearly all the
          modules that make it up are written new already and are not
          based on the MIT code. This would allow this version to not
          require any MIT royalties.

       b) Time - approx 6 Months from now for well tested system out
          for Beta testing with customers.

    2. K processor with IOP on VMEBUS - Zeta-lisp & development sys
       a) Description
          This configuration consists of a K processor and an IOP
          installed on the VMEBUS. The actual box could be either a
          Sun box, a Silicon Graphics box, or a custom box (whichever
          we decide, but preferably only one of the three). The
          software will be all the code from phase-I with the addition
          of a zeta-lisp compatibility package, a flavors package, and
          all of the standard Lisp Machine applications programs
          (ZMACS, SUPDUP, etc). This configuration is intended to as
          close as possible to the Lambda software as possible. It
          provides all the development facilities found in a Lambda.
          (If step three can happen fast enough, then this step could
          be skipped, but that should be decided later.)

       b) Time - Approx 4 months after Phase-I

    3. K processor with IOP and/or SUN - network window system
       a) Description
          The hardware configuration for this phase is the same as
          that in either phase-I or phase-II. The difference is that
          the window system has been replaced by a networked window
          system. The particular window system is left as a future
          decision (NEWS, XWINDOWS, etc.) depending on what resolves
          out as the standard.
             The version of this system with the sun processor allows
          use of the Lisp environment on both the local sun processor
          and remote ones on the net. The IOP version is only a remote
          Lisp server.

       b) Time - Approx 4-5 months after Phase-II

    4. Put out the IBM-PC or MAC-II based machine.
       a) Description
          This is a longer term project. This requires the development
          of some semi-custom logic to fit the K into either a MAC-II
          and/or IBM-PC/XT/AT/PS2. This could be a high volume high
          performance system at a relative low price. The window
          system for this version would be the approriate thing for
          the host box (IE MS-WINDOWS or MAC window stuff).

       b) Time - Approx 2 years from now.
