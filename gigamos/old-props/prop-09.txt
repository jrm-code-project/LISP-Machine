A. INTRODUCTION

Argument descriptors have been implemented on the Lambda in a
processor-dependent fashion, and they are used quite widely throughout
the system.  The following is a proposal for modularizing the
implementation, thereby facilitating the Falcon port.

I suspect that Lambda argument descriptors are just the tip of this
particular iceberg.  There are many related parts of the system that use
system constants and microcode routines, and they may be handled in a
similar fashion.

B. BACKGROUND/CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION

An argument descriptor is a fixnum which is packed with information
describing how a function takes arguments.  The most common use is to
get the minimum and maximum number of arguments accepted by a function.
(Note that the current implementation allows at most 63 function
arguments.)

ARGS-INFO and %ARGS-INFO are both used in system code; both return the
numeric argument descriptor for a given function.  The LISP ARGS-INFO
version accepts function specs and invokes the microcode %ARGS-INFO
version once it has processed its argument.

The following table of byte specs and bit field values is taken from the
file SYS:COLD;QCOM.LISP, which defines these constants for the processor
(they are loaded during the cold system build and are used by microcode
routines).  Constants with two percent signs prefixed (%%) are byte
specifiers for use with, e.g., LDB or DBP (and thus would have to change
for the Falcon).  Constants with one percent sign prefixed (%) are bit
field values for use with, e.g., LOGAND.

CONSTANT                        VALUE (OCTAL)   COMMENTS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
%ARG-DESC-QUOTED-REST           10000000        ;has quoted rest argument
%%ARG-DESC-QUOTED-REST          (BYTE 1. 21.)

%ARG-DESC-EVALED-REST           40000000        ;has evaluated rest argument
%%ARG-DESC-QUOTED-REST          (BYTE 1. 20.)

%ARG-DESC-ANY-REST              (BYTE 2. 20.)   ;has either kind of rest argument

%ARG-DESC-FEF-QUOTE-HAIR        20000000        ;compiled fcn with hairy quoting
%%ARG-DESC-FEF-QUOTE-HAIR       (BYTE 1. 19.)   ; must check ADL for full info

%ARG-DESC-INTERPRETED           10000000        ;interpreted function, and/or
%%ARG-DESC-INTERPRETED          (BYTE 1. 18.)   ; no information available
                                                ; (VALUE = 1000077) ***

%ARG-DESC-FEF-BIND-HAIR         40000000        ;compiled function with hairy
%ARG-DESC-FEF-BIND-HAIR         (BYTE 1. 17.)   ; binding, linear enter must check
                                                ; ADL

%ARG-DESC-MIN-ARGS              (BYTE 6. 6.)    ;minimum number of required args
%ARG-DESC-MAX-ARGS              (BYTE 6. 0.)    ; maximum number of required +
                                                ; optional (all positional, not
                                                ; rest) args

*** NOTE: Interpreted functions do not necessarily have this value.

C. SCOPE/WHERE ARGUMENT DESCRIPTORS ARE USED

The modules that utilize argument descriptors include:

  o Interpreter
  o Compiler
  o DESCRIBE (describing functions)
  o Macro-expansion (AUTOMATIC-DISPLACE)
  o Debugger / error handler (displaying/modifying frames)
  o Resources (getting arg-lists of parametizer functions)
  o Function typing (FUNCTIONP)

For my own convenience, I assembled a list of functions and files
calling %ARGS-INFO or ARGS-INFO, and collected these definitions (DEFUNs
and fragments thereof) into one file.  I verified this information by
doing a Tags Search on SYSTEM for "%ARG-DESC".

D. PORTABILITY RECOMMENDATIONS

1.) Fix QCOM to compute these values via calls to BYTE, if possible.
This requires that a decision be made as to how QCOM type definitions
(and cold loading generally) will be handled for the Falcon system.

2.) Define WITH-ARGS-INFO (macro) and functions for getting the arg-desc
elements with a single call to ARGS-INFO.

This facility is designed to minimize calls to ARGS-INFO, a goal of the
existing implementation.

WITH-ARGS-INFO (MACRO): (FUNC VARLIST &BODY BODY)
Executes BODY with the variables listed in VARLIST bound
  to argument information values for function FUNC.
Specify variable names corresponding to the desired argument information;
  use NIL to indicate a value that will not be computed.

The available values, in order, are:

  - MIN-ARGS, the minimum number of positional (required + optional)
              arguments expected by FUNC
  - MAX-ARGS, the maximum number of positional arguments expected by FUNC
  - QUOTED-REST-P, non-NIL if FUNC takes a quoted &REST arg
  - EVALED-REST-P, non-NIL if FUNC takes an evaluated &REST arg
  - ANY-REST-P, non-NIL if FUNC takes either kind of &REST arg
  - INTERPRETED-P, non-NIL in certain cases for interpreted functions, or
                   when no information is available
  - QUOTE-HAIR-P, caller must check ADL for "hairy" quoting information
  - BIND-HAIR-P, caller must check ADL for "hairy" binding information

To access the argument information directly, specify FUNC as a list,
(FUNC INFO):

  - FUNC, element 1, is a function object or function spec;
  - INFO, element 2, is a variable to which argument information is bound.

For example:

   (with-args-info function-spec (min max)
     (format t "~&~A takes from ~D. to ~D. arguments"
             function-spec min max))

3) Replace invocations of ARGS-INFO and %ARGS-INFO in the system with
calls to WITH-ARGS-INFO.  Where %ARGS-INFO is being called directly now,
the call to ARGS-INFO will require two additional type checks; the
increased portability compensates for the slight overhead.

There are several advantages to this change:

a) A uniform, high-level argument descriptor interface is provided;

b) Only ARGS-INFO will call %ARGS-INFO, and only the new macro will call
ARGS-INFO;

c) Only one (centralized) modification should be required to make
argument descriptors work on the Falcon.  If it is determined that a
very different argument descriptor implementation is needed (or already
provided in Falcon code), ARGS-INFO "users" (in the system software)
will not need to be modified.

Comments:

[JIM]

The slots of the argument descriptor need to be setf'able.
I think that this argues that there should be an equivalent
set of functions to access single slots.
