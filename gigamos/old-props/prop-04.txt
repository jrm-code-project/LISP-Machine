                          Flagging Source File Changes

The Problem.

     Whenever one of the several Falcon implementors makes a change to any
source code, there is always a chance that the change wil be incorrect, or at
least will impact some other part of the system in an unanticipated way.  It is
important to be readily able to identify recent changes (and even not-so-recent
changes), because as the ancient programming adage says: "The bug is usually the
last thing you fixed."

     If we were only a single person, it might be possible to rely upon memory
to identify changes.  However, we are many people, and therefore need a
mechanism to make changes visible.  M-X Source Compare is one such mechanism,
but unfortunately, it requires an act of commission, and is clumsy if there are
many scattered changes in a file.


The Proposal.

     Whenever anyone makes a source change to a Falcon source file, he should
flag the change with a comment containing (at least) the following string:

          ||| <userid> <dd><mon><yy>

The three vertical bars are intended to make these comments easily findable
someday when we might want to delete them.  It is of course helpful to include
some brief comment about what was changed.  To make the format clearer, here is
a sample:

          ;; made pkg optional - ||| smh 19sep88
          (defvar lisp-symbols '(
             ...
             array::length                      ;added ||| smh 19sep88
             ... )

     Although it has been discussed that these comments should appear on
separate lines to facilitate automatic purgation, others have held the position
that this additional formatting requirement will cruftify the code more than it
necessary.  Therefore, these ||| markers may where appropriate be put in
comments on the same line as the code affected.

     The intention is that when a few, small, localized changes are made to a
file, they will be flagged individually using this mechanism.  However, when
extensive systemic changes are made it is reasonable to place a single flag near
the top of each file affected.  If nothing else, this will provide a better
handle for efficiently using M-X Source Compare.

     This proposal is intended to apply to *all* Falcon source files, i.e., all
files which are pointed to by the master K-SYS: K; SYSTEM.LISP file.  This even
includes those lambda files which the cross compiler shares with the native
Lambda compiler.  We might or might not extend it someday to Mac support files,
but they are not presently at issue.

     It should be further understood that edit history comments in code are
intended to be temporary.  Anyone is free to flush uninteresting ones after four
to six months have elapsed.  Discretion is needed.  Obviously, the history of
some changes becomes uninteresting relatively quickly (but *never* so soon as a
month or two!!) while comments about the motivation for other changes may become
an important part of the design record, and may be worthy of permanent
retention.





Comments:

Jim:

I like the intent of this proposal but am concerned about the long term effect
of having comments like
;;; ||| I moved this macro to the head of the file
litter the code for years to come. I also agree that it is dangerous to try to
have a tool automatically edit code.

Instead I simply suggest that we agree that after an appropriate period of time
(I suggest 6 months) that the comments can be edited to reflect the true state
of the exiting code and comments in place simply to note that a change has taken
place can be removed.

Smh:  I agree with this, and have edited the proposal accordingly.

Jim:

I would like to propose that this proposal be modified to discuss the coding
conventions discussed below.
    Subject: Coding conventions

         If you see a place in the code which could be optimized:
        ;; @@@ Turn this into a macro later when stablized.  --wkf
         If you see a place in the code which is broken:
        ;; +++ This does not handle boundary cases properly.  --wkf

    I was just going through my old mail and saw this.
    What do people think about merging this into
    smh's prop-04?

Accordingly when the code has been corrected to be a macro (for @@@)
or handles boundary cases correctly (for +++) that a ||| comment be
left behind for later deletion as per normal practice for ||| comments

Status: Accepted 23sep88
