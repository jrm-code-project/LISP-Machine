;;; BOOTING THE FALCON FROM A LAMBDA

;;; NB: The expressions "Falcon" and "K" are still reasonably
;;; interchangeable.

;;; First, find a working FALCON band (one whose partition
;;; comment includes the word "KCOLD") or else evaluate the
;;; following form:

(make-system 'falcon :noconfirm)
 :
 :
 :

;;; Once the Falcon system has been made on your machine,
;;; evaluate the form:

(update-k-system)
 :
 :
 :

;;; Next we cal LAM:K-LOCAL-SETUP with the number of the slot
;;; which has been allocated to the Falcon Memory board.  We
;;; obtain this number by visiting the machine room and counting
;;; slots from the right of our machine's backplane, until we
;;; come to the double-boarded Falcon slot pair.  One of the two
;;; boards is the Falcon Processor board; the other is the K
;;; Memory board.  The Falcon Memory board has two distinguish-
;;; ing characteristics: 1) It has a number of SIMS (memory
;;; chips) protruding from its right side, and 2) the slot to
;;; its right is empty, to make room for the protruding SIMS.

;;; If evaluation of this form returns anything other than the
;;; fixnum 2, something is out of order.  Seek human assistance.

;;; This step initializes the Falcon and leaves it running
;;; in a debugger loop.
