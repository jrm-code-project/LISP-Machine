Name:   Introduction to the Falcon document

Date:   9/19/88

Participants:   K. Corbett, D. Saslav, all Falcon programmers

Est. Work:      Four weeks

Project status: Under review

Purpose: This document will serve as the primary introductory volume for
new Falcon customers.  By analogy with the Lambda, it will comprise the
equivalent of the Introduction to the Lambda and the Lambda Operations
Manual.

Description: This document will contain information required by new
Falcon users for understanding these basic Falcon concepts:

        LISP machine introduction;
        Description of the keyboard layout and mouse functions;
        Booting and restarting the Falcon;
        Online help facilities;
        The File System;
        The Window System;
        The Editor;
        Maintenance programs (Peek, Inspector, etc.)

        A significant body of text exists for the equivalent topics for
the Lambda; with the exception of the keyboard layout, it is conceivable
that none of the topics in the second group will have to be written
entirely from scratch; revision and reformatting of existing
documentation may be a viable approach to this manual.
