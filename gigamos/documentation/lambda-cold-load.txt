                   PART I: WHAT IS THIS DOCUMENT FOR?

     This document describes the process of building new Lambda software
systems, "from scratch".  This can only be done by first constructing a
"cold load band," a partition of your Lambda disk which contains an
extremely rudimentary ("inner") LISP world.  The cold load world
contains virtually none of the important interfacing features offered by
finished Lambda systems, and thus is not suited for any form of Lambda
development other than new system construction.  In fact, cold load
bands are designed specifically for one purpose only: to be able to
perform sufficient computation to construct a new, clean LISP world for
use in development and in running application software.

     Making a cold load world is, then, a rather drastic step.  When is
it necessary or desirable to make a cold load world?  To answer this
question, it is almost necessary to understand completely the mechanism
involved in building a cold load world.  Put simply, though, new cold
load worlds reflect fundamental LISP changes made to your environment
through modification of certain critical source files.  These files are
listed in the file "SYS:SYS;INNER-SYSTEM-FILE-ALIST".

     The files in si:inner-system-file-alist are modified less
frequently than other source files, and for good reason.  However, as
changes to these files do occur, it is a good idea to construct new cold
load worlds on a periodic basis.  In addition, you should construct a
new cold world whenever a known change or set of changes is made to one
or more of these files

     Constructing a cold load band requires:

        o a dedicated system configuration consisting of a 2x2 Lambda
          processor (with two monitors).

        o one Lambda partition consisting of at least 12000 pages of
          virtual memory.  This is the "CLDx" partition which will
          receive the new cold load band.  In addition, to build a new
          world, a load band ("LODx" partition) of at least 25000 pages
          is required.  This is the partition which will hold the new,
          bootable world band.

     The procedure lasts approximately fifteen hours from start to
finish (assuming continuous, successful operation).  (A continuously
successful operation has not been observed to date.)

     Parts of this procedure must be performed from one of the two
available Lambda monitors; where relevant, each monitor-specific
instruction will be preceded by an indicative line such as:

***************                                       ***************
FROM MONITOR 1:                 or                    FROM MONITOR 2:
***************                                       ***************

     This document assumes that the reader is intimately familiar with
Lambda operations, including the MAKE-SYSTEM mechanism.  Anyone
attempting to create a cold load band should have a relatively complete
knowledge of the status of system bugs at the time of the cold load
construction.


                      PART II: COMPILING THE SYSTEM

1. Begin by checking to see that all desired patches have been included
in the world (i.e., their source files updated to include all desired
changes).  Once this has been accomplished, decide which compiling
strategy you wish to follow:

        o If you wish to recompile all source files, evaluate the form

          (MAKE-SYSTEM 'SYSTEM :RECOMPILE :DEFAULTED-BATCH)

        o If you wish only to recompile those source files which have
          changed since they were last compiled, evaluate the form

          (MAKE-SYSTEM 'SYSTEM :COMPILE :DEFAULTED-BATCH)

        o If you know that all source files have been successfully
          compiled, and wish to have them make up the new world "as is",
          simply evaluate

          (MAKE-SYSTEM 'SYSTEM :DEFAULTED-BATCH)

        With the :DEFAULTED-BATCH keyword, you may leave the process
unattended, if you prefer.  MAKE-SYSTEM will keep a file of compiler warnings
which you can review via the ZMacs "Edit System Warnings" command.
:DEFAULTED-BATCH also turns off more-processing, answers all questions without
the aid of user input, and inhibits function redefinition warnings.

     It is also a good idea to recompile the OUTER-SYSTEM system, which
contains the file system, ZWEI, etc.  OUTER-SYSTEM is loaded late in the
process of making the world band.

     When recompiling the Lambda sources, be sure to do so from a LISP
Listener that is using the ZetaLISP (ZL) readtable.  (That is only necessary
at this time because some files do not have the appropriate readtable
attribute set.  Such a source file written in ZL will not compile correctly
from a CommonLISP listener.)

     Recompiling a full system currently takes approximately 12 hours to run
(on the system host).  Of course, the exact time will vary, depending on
problems that may be encountered, and as the size of the total system grows
and shrinks.

2. Find partitions of sufficient size for the cold load band and bootable
world load band.  To see the available partitions, execute:

     (SI:DESCRIBE-PARTITIONS)

     The cold load band will require a partition containing at least 12K
pages, and the world load band must be at least 25K pages.  The partitions
should have names of the form "CLDx" and "LODx", respectively, where x is an
integer less than 10.  Note that it is acceptable to use an existing, obsolete
"LOD" partition in place of a "CLD" partition.


                 PART III: LOADING THE COLD LOAD BUILDER

3.  Recompile and/or load the cold load builder by evaluating

     (MAKE-SYSTEM 'COLD :RECOMPILE :DEFAULTED-BATCH)
  or (MAKE-SYSTEM 'COLD :NOCONFIRM).

This should take at most twenty minutes.


                    PART IV: MAKING A COLD LOAD WORLD

4.  Now use the cold load builder to create the cold load world and store it
in the 12K page "CLDx" band.  Execute:

        (COLD:MAKE-COLD "CLDx")

where x represents the number of the selected CLD partition.

     COLD:MAKE-COLD creates a cold load world by loading all of the files
specified by SI:LAMBDA-COLD-LOAD-FILE-LIST into the specified partition.  As
discussed in Part I, making changes to any of these files necessitates the
construction of a new Lambda system.

     COLD:MAKE-COLD requires confirmation before taking effect; after user
confirmation, this process takes approximately forty minutes to complete.


      PART V: MAKING THE NEW LAMBDA WORLD FROM THE COLD LOAD WORLD

***************
FROM MONITOR 1:
***************

5. Run a cold load server by pressing <System>-7.

     The first of the two monitors divides into two windows, one labeled "LAM"
and one labeled "Mini Server Window".  LAM is the microcode debugger; it
enables debugging of the companion processor of your (2x2) Lambda.  The Mini
Server acts as a file server for the cold load band, accepting single file
load requests via shared memory, fetching the file over the network.

***************
FROM MONITOR 1:
***************

6. Move the mouse to the Mini Server Window and click, making this window
the currently selected window.  From the Mini Server Window, evaluate

     (mini-server-process)

***************
FROM MONITOR 2:
***************

7.  Bring up the SDU Newboot program by typing
control-meta-control-meta-<LINE>.  The Newboot program's command loop is
recognizable by its prompt, which is

     COMMAND:

***************
FROM MONITOR 2:
***************

8.  Set the current band to the "CLD" band located in step (3), by
typing

     COMMAND: set-band CLDx

to the COMMAND: prompt.

***************
FROM MONITOR 1:
***************

9A.  It is now time to boot from the new cold load band.  Click the mouse in
the LAM window.  Initialize LAM by executing (SETUP) and choose the option
"L".  Then run LAM by executing (LAM), and type the command :REBOOT followed
by a carriage return.  This command attempts to boot the companion (Monitor 2)
processor.

     If the processor fails to boot, try again, by proceeding to step (9B).

     If, on the other hand, the LAM :reboot command successfully initiates a
booting sequence on the companion processor, then the string "-RUN-" will
appear on Monitor 1, and the wholine will indicate that the processor is in
the "Stop or Input" state.  If at any time before the booting sequence
finishes the string "STOP" appears on Monitor 1, and the wholine changes to
indicate the "Keyboard" state, the cold load has halted in microcode, and you
will need to debug.  Otherwise, a "lisp" <?> prompt will appear on Monitor 1,
and you should proceed to step (11).

     Booting all processors takes approximately fifteen minutes to finish.

***************
FROM MONITOR 2:
***************

(EXECUTE THIS STEP ONLY IF THE COMPANION PROCESSOR DOES NOT START
BOOTING IN RESPONSE TO THE :REBOOT COMMAND.)

9B. If the companion processor fails to begin booting after step (9A), press
control-meta-control-meta-end on Monitor 2 and type

  boot

to the newboot COMMAND: prompt, followed by a carriage return. This command
should cause the processor associated with monitor 2 to begin booting.  When
the processor has finished booting, proceed to step (10).

     Booting the second processor takes approximately 15 minutes.

***************
FROM MONITOR 2:
***************

10. Evaluate the form:

        (SI:QLD)

EXERCISE EXTREME CARE TO TYPE THIS FORM CORRECTLY!  Neither microcode traps
nor error-handlers have been defined at this stage of cold load construction;
any error or trap here will force you to repeat step (9).

     The function QLD uses the Mini Server to load all of the files
defined in the file "SYS:SYS;INNER-SYSTEM-FILE-ALIST".  QLD then
executes (si:lisp-reinitialize), which brings up a Lisp Listener, with
accompanying error handler, on Monitor 2.  This eliminates the need to
use LAM for the duration of the Lambda system construction process.
Another result of si:lisp-reinitialze's evaluation is the creation of a
basic network, thus eliminating the need for further use of the Mini
Server.

     QLD also does a (make-system 'system), thereby loading the rest of
the world, and then prompts the user for other systems to be loaded at
this stage, with the prompt

        List of names of additional systems to load:

When you see this prompt, you should simply type

        (outer-system)

to indicate that you wish to load all of the standard user interface
systems.

     Finally, QLD performs a full garbage collection and object LISP
analysis of the system, and prints out the processor's disk label.

     (si:qld) takes approximately four hours to finish evaluating.

***************
FROM MONITOR 2:
***************

11.  Choose a "LOD" partition from the disk label large enough to hold the
newly created world (approximately 25,000 pages), and evaluate

     (disk-save "LODx")

using the selected partition as argument.  The disk-save will take
approximately fifteen minutes, after which time you will have completed
building the system, and Lambda operations may commence.
