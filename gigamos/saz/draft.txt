After clicking on EDIT in zmail's profile editor,...

While profile editing from the zwei buffer (bottom pane, as opposed to
scrolling menu), clicking on small command boxes (exit, universes, etc.)
surrounding the main scrolling menu not only has no effect, but also
causes these boxes to invert their video.  These ineffectual
video-inversions remain even after user has typed #/End to finish edit.

Clicking on one of those boxes during an EDIT should either force an
#/End to the zwei edit session (and then execute the command clicked
on), or else these boxes should not even be mouse-sensitive.
