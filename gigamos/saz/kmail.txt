Message received, contents follow for Keith's benefit:

        KMac is also a file type we're requesting from Apple.  It will
        be used for files needed by the KMac application itself, such as
        configuration files.

In the future, let's use our wonderful mail environment as propitiously
as possible (that is, let's be sure to cc: both of the others in any
documentation-related messages).  The first file in the fcc: list above
(angel:/lmi/doc/kmac/KMAIL.TXT) will be the archive for messages.
The latter may be used as a backup source for angel-downtime.

Do FCC's remain in header fields at upon replies in ZMail? I wonder.
