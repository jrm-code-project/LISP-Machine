Name:   Microcode Analysis Project

Date:   9/12/88

Programmers:    K. Corbett, D. Saslav

Est. Work:      12-15 weeks

Project status: Under review

Purpose:        This project is intended as a part of the effort to port the Lambda operating system to the Falcon.  A detailed analysis of all Lambda microcode is required to classify each microcode routine into one of the following categories:

                %               Performance optimizations;
                %               Standard primitives;
                %               Hardware dependencies;
                %               Portable routines;
                %        Asynchronous routines.

        Having achieved such a classification for each microcoded routine, it will then be possible to determine how to rewrite some of these modules to ensure a smooth inter-machine port and a robust final product.

Justification:  Equivalent microcode is not provided on the Falcon.  As a result, a project of  this kind is necessary in order to assess the overall difficulty of the Lambda-to-Falcon system port.

Procedure:      Analyze and classify all microcoded Lambda routines into one of the following five categories:

        I. Lambda performance optimizations:

        These microcoded routines have been written solely to optimize the Lambda operating system,  and do not require porting to the Falcon.

        II. Standard Common LISP primitives:

        These are functions, macros, and other Common LISP definitions which already have microcode implementations for the Falcon.  Assuming that all such implementations  pass the requisite suite of Common LISP tests, no further work will be required to ensure proper Falcon functionality for these definitions.

        III. Hardware dependencies:

        These are the LISP definitions which have been implemented in a processor-dependent fashion, and for which equivalent Falcon assembler routines are needed.  In each such case, careful analyses of the nature of any hardware dependencies, and the means by which equivalent Falcon routines may be written, will be required.                             (Procedure continued on next page.)
Procedure:      IV. Portable routines:
(Continued)
        This is the set of microcoded LISP definitions which have been implemented in a non-processor-dependent fashion, in adherence with the guidelines set forth by the Common LISP specification.  Given the presence and proper functioning of the routines in Group II (standard Common LISP primitives), the definitions of Group IV should port without further human effort.

        V. Asynchronous routines:

        These are microcoded routines which have been written to handle inter-process and extra-machine interactions on the Lambda (e.g., the trap handler).  Some of these may require porting to the Falcon, and some may not.  Those asynchronous routines requiring porting must be identified and analyzed from a hardware perspective, to ensure correct Falcon behavior, then analyzed from a software perspective for portability considerations, and, lastly, rewritten for or simply ported to the Falcon (depending on the results of the aforementioned software analysis).
