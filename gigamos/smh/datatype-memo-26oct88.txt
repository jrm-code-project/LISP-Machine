Pierre:

     At this point we have all tentatively agreed that trapping to handle inline
datatype test failure will be a bottleneck and that test failures should be
handled in some way either by a jump or a call.  there are any number of ways
this could be set up.  What I want to do here is outline what the software
*needs* to do to handle a datatype failure, and what hardware support would
enhance code speed.  We need to find a mechanism that is both efficient and
which is implementable in the hardware.

     Let us consider the following sample instruction which does a 32-bit
"fixnum" add of the lisp values in A5 and A9, leaving the result in A3.  (Since
we do not yet have a definite assembler syntax for the Phoenix -- and indeed,
since we are still discussing exactly what the instructions are supposed to do
-- all code samples below sbould be considered "pseudo-code."  Where there is
ambiguity the instruction syntax and semantics will be explained in text.)

        (ADD-32 A3 A5 A9 DT-FIXNUM DT-BOTH)

In the current Falcon board hardware, the 24-bit analogue of this instruction
simply traps if either datum is not a fixnum, or if the sum overflows.  In the
alternative schemes we are considering, a branch or call if done to some other
sort handler.  Regardless, let us consider what the handler has to do: By
examination of the original instruction it must somehow locate the two arguments
(here A5 and A9) as well as the destination (A3), perform the appropriate
generic operation based on the real types of the arguments, leave the result in
the destinatoin, and finally return to the mainline instruction stream.  All
this needs to be done efficiently.  At least for datatypes that can be operated
upon at high speed by the hardware -- i.e. fixnums and some kinds of floats --
we desire that generic operation overhead not take significantly longer time
than the operation itself.  (This is the definition of a bottleneck.)
