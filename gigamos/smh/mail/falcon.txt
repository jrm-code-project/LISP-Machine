To make our life easier in the future, please follow these conventions when coding:

 If you see a place in the code which could be optimized:

;; @@@ Turn this into a macro later when stablized.  --wkf

 If you see a place in the code which is broken:

;; +++ This does not handle boundary cases properly.  --wkf

This way we can tag search for "@@@" and "+++" and quickly find all such places.

Thanks.

To avert possible confusion due to changing of variable *cold-files*,
The function (k-cold:cold-loader-forget-everything) should assure the
rebinding of *cold-files*.

s I understand it, Doug found a critical path in the hardware at 50 Mhz and slowed the clock
down to 44 MHz and the problem went away. The debug machine in the middle of the room
is still operating at 50 MHz.
