I don't think PROGV and PROGW are going to work.  The rewrites
are Lambda-specific.  We'll need a way to suppress lambda-oid
rewrites in favor of appropriate P2-FOR-K hackery.

The lambda compiler should be smart enough to turn MEMBER into MEMQ in
all of the following:

        (member 'foo ...)
        (member ... '(x y z))

Specifically, if the first arg to MEMBER is a constant SYMBOL, or if the
second arg is a constant list of SYMBOLs, then the transformation is
legitimate.  Numbers could be special cased as well, but this is less
frequently useful.

This would improve both lambda and K code speed.

Compiling the following function blows up the lambda compiler.

   (DEFUN BOO (NAME)
     (LET
       ((A A))
       1))

The problem is in P!LET when it tries to flush the `useless' binding of
the local A to itself.

This is just a note to myself to fix it someday, as it also affects
the falcon cross compiler...

Subject: compiler blows the lambda away
To: bug-lispm@GSI-CAM
Message-ID: <[GSI-ALEX].22-Sep-88 20:30:00.smh>

Compiling the following function creates bad data and *halts* a lambda:

(defun blimp ()
  (let (*print-array*)
    #'(lambda ()
        (multiple-value-setq (*print-array*)
          (foo)))))

There are two problems.

(1) The variable scoping analysis code in pass 1 is bizzarre and almost
certainly incorrect.  I have not fixed this yet.

(2) Some lamebrain decided it was necesary to shave a couple microcode
cycles in the compiler and use subprimitives to manipulate flag bits.
Unfortunately, problem (1) causes the subprimitive to receive a
non-numeric argument, so an invalid lisp object is created, and the
whole machine crashes or halts.  I put an error check in
COMPILER:QCOMPILE0 to catch and report the error gracefully without
crashing the machine.

    >>ERROR: ETYPECASE failure; the value of COMPILER::DEST, MICROSECOND-INCREMENT,
             is not a return dest, EQL either IGNORE or COMPILER::D-IGNORE, a functional dest, a register dest, a new frame dest, a progdesc, a multiple values, an open frame, a var or a new var.

This is fixed.  MULTIPLE-VALUE-SETQ couldn't properly special vars.
