This paper is a brief project survey for adding compilation environment support
to the fleabit compiler.  The compilation environment mechanism already is
implemented on the lambda cross compiler.  However, it has not yet been
exercised.

A compilation environment is a data structure that contains things like symbol
properties and macro definitions.  The current compilation environment is stored
in si:*compilation-environment*, and the cross compiler looks there before
looking in the compilation world.  When a definition is made during a cross
COMPILE or cross COMPILE-FILE, the definition is stored in the current
compilation environment.

A single compilation environment is maintained within the lambda cross-compiling
world which stores everything that is known

Compilation environments nest within one another.  One "global" compilation
environment remembers everything that has been defined for the falcon in that
world.  When a cross COMPILE-FILE is done, a new compilation environment is
created for the duration of the COMPILE-FILE in which to hold definitions within
that file.  This new environment nests within the global environment.  At the
end of the compilation, the compilation environment is written out to a FDEF
file, and the compialtion environment is discarded.  However, these definitions
may be loaded into the copiling world simply by loading the FDEF file.  This
parallels the action of loading a compiled file when doing native compilation,
except, of course, that actual DEFUNs are not loaded.  This mechanism is similar
to and replaces the KDEF file mechanism.

These are the anticipated tasks:

[1] The compilation environment support code already installed in QCDEFS and
QCFILE is sufficient and should only require calls inserted in the top level
fleabit compilation driver.

[2] Hooks for FDEF files need to be added to MAKE-SYSTEM.  This shouldn't be a
big deal.  It wants to be done for the cross compiler anyway.

[3] The fleabit compiler needs some rather minor modifications to integrate the
complation environment mechanism.  A cut at this can be done in a couple hours.
The locations of the changes are surveyed in "dj:smh;places.lisp".






[4] Freeze and checkpoint the entire K source tree and recompile it from scratch
to verify that the sources are not somehow broken.

[5] This is the big one.  All the fleabit-compiled files need to be edited.
First, the file packages need to be changed so that each file is in one of the
surviving packages below.  Then all the package-qualified symbols in the code
need to be converted.  Generally these package-qualified symbols fall into two
classes: The ones that are trying to name public lisp symbols can simply have
their package qualifiers deleted (because the new package scheme will not
differentiate between for example lisp:cons on the Falcon and Lambda); the ones
which name non-public hardware constants or internal service routines (e.g.
LI:BIND) will remain package qualified, and in some cases the package qualifier
will change.

[6] Recompile everything and debug.

Tasks [1-3] can be implemented and tested by one person (estimate a couple
days).  Then, all K development should cease for [4] (one day, assuming the
sources are not already broken).  For [5], each developer would be assigned some
portion of the files to edit (estimate one day).  Debugging the system [6] to
make it run again could easily take another several days.  However, there are
certainly risks that the debugging could take longer.

After the change, the package system on the K would be rationalized thus:
   - LISP.  This would contain and export the 775 Common Lisp symbols.
(Actually, the Lambda has slight discrepencies with this list, which the K
should preserve for now.)
   - GLOBAL.  This would contain and autoexport essentially the same symbol as
on the Lambda.
   - SI.  This would also have analogous content and usage as on the Lambda.
   - HW.  On both machines this would be the repository for hardware constants
and the like.
   - K.  On both machines this would continue to hold (mostly) symbolic names
for K machine registers, etc.
   - LI.  On both machines this would name the internal routines which are
the low machine support for running K code and which are (for example) called
directly by compiled code, e.g., LI:BIND.
