Subject:  Agenda for visit -- Oct 26-27 1988

     I'll have our "usual" travel arrangements except that the visit will span
two days: arrival at SilicArt 10:30-11:00 Thursday and departure around 17:00
Friday.

     I view this as a technical working visit so we can have time not only to
exchange views but to grapple with actual design issues in a relaxed manner.
However, since I can't pretend to represent the entire Cambridge development
group, I don't propose we make any "final" decisions.  Rather, we'll work out
what we can and I'll communicate the results and any newly-discovered issues
back to the group.

     Here are the issues which I see as currently active.  These are not in any
particular order, and we may not need to create a firm schedule in advance.
However, if you think its appropriate, feel free to work out a tentative
schedule according to the availablities of your staff.  Also, please distribute
this agenda to the others.


                              * * *  Agenda  * * *

- Consideration of Unix/C support.
  - Review and interpretation of Pace Willisson's report.  (I'll bring a copy.)
  - Additional issues.
  - The position (importance) of Unix within the project.
  - We should study SPARC and MC88000 towards developing a comparitive analysis
    paper.  (This issue transcends Unix/C, of course.)

- Review of call hardware design.  (Is there a revised document?)  We feel we
  are probably nearing preliminary approval on this.

- Datatype-checking architecture.
  Pierre and I have been considering alternatives, but still haven't come
  to closure.  I want to present some additional software considerations on
  what the processor has to perform to avoid software bottlenecks.

- Memory Architecture
  - How much physical memory does this processor *really* need to perform
    adequately?  How do we determine a trustworthy estimate?
  - Is that amount of memory achievable?  At what cost?
  - If the machine requires more memory than can be achieved with the proposed
    static ram design, what should we do?  This is neither a hardware nor a
    software problem:  We need to take a "total system" design approach.

- Transporter RAM changes (removal?).
  Pierre and I had a brief preliminary discussion.  We should continue at least
  to the point that I can present the proposal to the others in Cambridge.
