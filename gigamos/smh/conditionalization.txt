                        [internal document -- smh 8Aug88]


     This document addresses how a single set of Lisp system source files can be
conditionalized and maintained to compile and run on the Lambda, K, and any
other processors that might be of interest.  Obviously, certain files
implementing low-level portions of each system (as well as components like
compiler code generators) are completely machine-dependent and must be
maintained separately, but the bulk of the files implementing the lisp language
and environment tools are `mostly' machine independent.  They require only
occasional conditionalizations for different processors or different run-time
environments.  However, the problem of cross compilation adds significantly to
the problems.

     This document attempts to establish a (very few) necessary standards needed
to bring up the lambda system on the Falcon.  All developers should read it and
either adopt the standards or suggest reasons for alternatives.




                     ====  Run-Time Code Conditionalization  ====

     Any number of places in run-time code require conditionalization for the
different processors and system options on which the code will run.  One way of
providing this conditionalization is to have code that explicitly checks some
status at run time.  This is sometimes reasonable if the condition being checked
is something which cannot be determined at compile time, e.g., whether or not a
floating-point accelerator is present on the run-time system.  However, run-time
checks are pointless for conditionalizing on processor type; there is no sense
for code compiled for a K processor to test whether it is running on a Lambda.
This `test' is implicitly be done at compile time.

     The normal way to implement a compile-time conditionalization is with the
read-time conditionalizers #+feature and #-feature.  These examine whether the
(keywordized) feature symbol is present on the system's *FEATURES* list.  This
mechanism is not sufficient to conditionalize for cross compilation because the
conditionalization depends on the machine doing the compilation (actually, the
reading) instead of the machine for which the code is being compiled.

     An extension has been made to the #+ and #- reader macros to support cross
compilation for multiple target processors.  The macros understand a new keyword
symbol which performs conditionalization with regard to SI:*TARGET-FEATURES*.
This is best illustrated by an example:

        (defconstant pi #+(target lambda) 3.14285s0
                        #+(target falcon) 22/7
                        #-(target (or lambda k)) 3.1415926s0)

*TARGET-FEATURES* is initially NIL and may be lambda bound as appropriate by
top-level cross-compilation drivers.  In order for source code to work when
*not* cross compiling, when *TARGET-FEATURES* is NIL the reader conditionalizers
will use *FEATURES* instead.



     For completeness, the syntax #+(LOCAL ...) is also understood and forces
conditionalization with regard to the compiling machine.  It would be used only
if conditionalization with regard to the compiling machine were needed somewhere
inside a target-conditionalized form.  This may never happen.

     The current initial value of the *FEATURES* list in the Lambda system is:

(:LAMBDA :LEXICAL :COMMONLISP :LOOP :DEFSTRUCT :LISPM :MIT :LMI :COMMON
 :CHAOS :SORT :FASLOAD :STRING :NEWIO :ROMAN :TRACE :GRINDEF :GRIND)

     The current initial value of the variable COMPILER:*FALCON-FEATURES* is the
same, except that :CHAOS is deleted and :LAMBDA is replaced by :FALCON.

     These reader macros should be used everywhere compile-time target
conditionalization of system source code is required.  (Actually, there may be
some exceptions, but we haven't thought of them yet.)  The symbol used to
conditionalize the Lambda processor should always be LAMBDA.  The symbol used to
conditionalize for the Falcon (aka K aka Phoenix) processor should always be
FALCON.  Later major revisions of the Falcon system may want to use a different
symbol, so we should try all to use the same one now and appropriate only the
minimum-necessary part of the namespace.

     There are certain functions in the compiler itself that are used both when
compiling for the Lambda and for the Falcon, for instance, in the optimizer.
This code should do run-time conditionalization on the value of
COMPILER:*TARGET-COMPUTER*, which will have either the value COMPILER::K or the
value COMPILER::LAMBDA-INTERFACE.  Good style usually indicates using ECASE
rather than IF to conditionalize.

     It is still open what we should use to conditionalize (for example) for the
operating-system host of the Falcon processor.  This could be conditionalized
either at compile time or at run time.  Since space is at a premium, we lean
towards compile-time conditionalization; however, we have not yet addressed the
issue in reality.



                      ====  Compilation Environments  ====


     The regular Lambda compiler now supports a new type of structure, the
COMPILER:COMPILATION-ENVIRONMENT.  It is implemented as a defstruct that
contains a couple internal hash tables.  It is a place where definitions
established during a compilation can be stored separate from the running
environment of the compiling machine.

     For instance, suppose the Lambda and K environments require different
expansions of the MULTIPLE-VALUE-BIND macro.  The two definitions can be
conditionalized using #+ reader macros.  However, when cross compiling (e.g.
compiling K code on the Lambda) one can't just redefine the Lambda's
MULTIPLE-VALUE-BIND because that will cause the Lambda to lose big the next time
some native code is compiled for the lambda.  So when doing a file compilation,
the compiler stores macro definitions and symbol properties inside a
compilation-environment structure which is freshly created for that compilation,
and which is discarded after the compilation.

     This is actually not a new mechanism.  The existing Lambda compiler
maintained several association lists during a file compilation which carried the
same data.  The new mechanism is more efficient, and permits long-term storage
of definitions.

     The CROSS-COMPILE-FOR-K cross compiler produces two output files.  The
Falcon compiled code file has the standard extension "FBIN".  In addition, a `K
Environment' file is also created with the standard extension "FENV".  It is a
QFASL-format file that contains all the file-local definitions accumulated in
the compilation-environment file.  When it is subsequently loaded into a world
the definitions will be added to the COMPILATION-ENVIRONMENT structure in
COMPILER:*COMPILATION-ENVIRONMENT*.  Loading a FENV file into a cross-compiling
Lambda world is analogous to loading the compiled FBIN into the Falcon world,
were compilation being done natively.  In other words, loading a FENV file into
the Lambda makes available to the cross compiler the macro and constant
definitions in a previously-compiled file.

     To make this work, COMPILATION-ENVIRONMENT structures are actually nested.
Each one has a NEXT field, which is either NIL or some other
COMPILATION-ENVIRONMENT from which it inherits additional definitions.  The
COMPILATION-ENVIRONMENT created for a COMPILE-FILE is automatically nested
inside the current binding of COMPILER:*COMPILATION-ENVIRONMENT*.  This
simulates the inheritance of the definitions in compiled files previously loaded
into the world.

     This mechanism happens automatically, so developers probably won't have to
worry about it very much.  Nesting of environments can occur to any depth, but
it is doubtful whether there will ever be any use for more than two levels.
However, COMPILE-FILE and QC-FILE now accept an explicit keyword
EXPLICIT-COMPILATION-ENVIRONMENT argument in case the MAKE-SYSTEM facility finds
use for more control.



    The following are the developer-visible functions which support cross
compilation.

    The function COMPILE-FILE-FOR-FALCON is just like COMPILE-FILE but invokes
the cross compiler instead, after binding *COMPILATION-ENVIRONMENT* to the value
stored in COMPILER:*FALCON-ENVIRONMENT*.  The version numbers of the FBIN and
FDEF files will be the same as the source file, just as is done for QFASL files.

    COMPILER:*FALCON-ENVIRONMENT* is a variable which holds a
COMPILATION-ENVIRONMENT structure.  This accumulates definitions from all the
FDEF files that have ever been loaded.

    The function LOAD-FALCON-DEFINITIONS is just like load except that it
defaults the pathname type to FDEF and binds *COMPILATION-ENVIRONMENT* to the
value in COMPILER:*FALCON-ENVIRONMENT*.
