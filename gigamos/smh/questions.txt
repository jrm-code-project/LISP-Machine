This is a list of issues which are not already obvious task items. They
either require study or information which we do not yet have.

KEY: To what project periods is the issue relevant?

      Hardware:
        *H0: Development (Immediate)
        *H1: Board-level processor
        *H2: First-generation chip processor
        *H3: Second-generation chip processor
        *H4: Future generations or applications
      Software:
        *S0: Alpha -- (immediate) support of development
        *S1: Beta release
        *S2: Release 1
        *S3: Release 1.5 (tuning)
        *S4: Release 2

I1. Physical site maintenance and support.
  I1a. Air conditioning. *H0
  I1b. Clean up machine room cabling. *H0
  I1c. Partitions. *H0

I2. K memory: static column vs page mode. *H0*H1*H2

I3. K memory: maximum memory. *H2

I4. Study K and disk power usage problems in MAC. *H2

I5. Investigate number of hardware stack frames. *H2

I6. Investigate instruction cache size. *H2

I7. Study trap/tag architecture vs software efficiency. *H3*H4

I8. Apple VAR software compatibility issues. *H0*H1*S0
    May affect K-MAC design spec.

I9. Compatibility with TI Mac product (Symbolics also?). *S0

I10. Do Lisp Machines need uucp? *S3*S4

I11. Should we write a quick K functional simulator (affects [I5] [I6]).
     *S0*H2*H3
