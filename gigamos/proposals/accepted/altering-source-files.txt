              A Proposal for Annotating Source File Changes

                       Revised Draft 24Oct88 - smh


BACKGROUND:

     Whenever one of the several Falcon implementors makes a change to
any source code, there are several dimensions along which this change
might require later scrutiny.  For example, a change might represent an
incomplete implementation requiring future augmentation.  Alternatively,
it could be a "stub" requiring a future substitution by other code.  In
many cases, changes have far-reaching performance implications.  In
general, the potential for subtle and not-so-subtle ramifications when
entering changes to source files obviates the need for rigorous
adherence to a standard source code comment-inclusion procedure.

DEFINITIONS:

     For the purposes of this Proposal, a "source file" is any file that
is pointed to by the relevant system defining file.  For Falcons this is
the file "JB: K; FALCON-SYSDEF.LISP".  In addition, "source file" refers
to any Lambda files which the cross compiler shares with the native
Lambda compiler.

     A future Proposal may suggest an extension of this definition to
Macintosh-supported files as well.

MECHANISM:

  A. ANNOTATING SOURCE CHANGES

     When modifying a Falcon source file, a developer demarcates the
changed section with a comment string containing all of the following
components:


    [;]_LISP-code_Comment-type-symbol_comment-text_<AUTHOR DATE>

 [;]

This indicates one or more semi-colon.  As a review, here is a summary
of standard practice for semi-colon usage in entering comments is as
follows:

     Long Comments:

        A Long Comment is a comment which takes up the entire horizontal
        space (possibly excluding line-initial whitespace) of one or
        more contiguous lines in a LISP file.  There are two kinds of
        Long Comment:

          Left Justified Long Comments (";;;"):

          Long Comments, all of whose lines begin in the left-most
          (0th) column of the file, are demarcated by three semi-colons.

          Code Justified Long Comments (";;"):

          Long Comments, all of whose lines begin in the same
          column as the opening parenthesis of the referent code, are
          demarcated with two semi-colons.

    In-line Comments (";"):

       An In-line Comment is one that does not occupy the entire
       horizontal line on which it is found; rather, it shares a line
       with (and may be found to the right of) the code to which it
       pertains.

_ ("Underbars")

Underbars in the above template indicate one or more spaces separating
two fields.

 LISP-code

In-line comments (see below for definition of comment types) which hide
pieces of LISP code from the reader, evaluator, compiler, etc. should be
left between the semi-colon and the Comment Type Symbol.

 comment-text

This is the text of the comment, and should be present for all types of
comment (as described below).

 Comment-type-symbol

The [Comment-type-symbol] field uniquely identifies the reason for the
comment's existence.  Currently, there are four kinds of CTS (Comment
Type Symbol):

    The Local Modification Demarcating CTS: "$$$"

    This CTS is used in comments when any textual changes have
    been entered in a source file.  The purpose of this CTS is
    to enable future file browsers to minimize the time spent
    determining whether the "Before" and "After" sections of
    the file are exactly the same or different in any way.  All
    code modification, reformatting, and redocumentation must
    have an accompanying Local Modification Demarcating CTS.

    The Systematic Modification Demarcating CTS: "&&&"

    This CTS is used at the beginning of files which have been
    modified in some global, systematic fashion.  See the
    section on Annotating Systematic Source Changes for more
    details.

    The Enhancement Suggestive CTS: "@@@"

    This CTS implies that its containing comment suggests an
    enhancement or an optimization technique from which the
    existing source code would likely benefit.  Use of this CTS
    does not necessarily imply that any actual source file code
    has been changed.

    The Maintenance Suggestive CTS: "+++"

    The use of this CTS in a comment indicates that the code to
    which it refers "requires" (as opposed to "would likely
    benefit from") maintenance.  Like the Enhancement
    Suggestive CTS, use of this CTS does not necessarily imply
    that any actual source file code has been changed.

Note that any combination of "$$$", "@@@", and "+++" could
exist in the same comment, depending on the particular
circumstances for which it was entered.

 <AUTHOR DATE>

The commentator should leave a unique, consistent insignia, set off by
angle brackets, identifying himself as the commentator.  Also in the
pair of brackets should be the date in the format <ddmmmyy>.

The following fictitious excerpt contains examples of both kinds of Long
Comments as well as an In-line Comment, demonstrating comments which do not
require CTS-style comments (those of the original code author) and those
which do.  For the purposes of this example, assume that John Q. Public
(jqp) wrote the new code on September 19, 1988.

;;; $$$ Inserted this variable for efficiency. <jqp 19sep88>
;;; $$$ Reformatted not to be all on one long line. <jrh 21sep88>
(defvar all-possible-alphabetic-text-symbols
  ;; This saves the evaluator all sorts of trouble at run time!
  (list 'a 'b 'c 'd 'e 'f 'g ; 'h $$$ I dislike the letter `h' <jd 20sep88>
        'i 'j 'k 'l 'm 'n 'o 'p
        'q 'r 's 't 'u 'v 'w 'x
        'y 'z
        ;; '0 '1 '2 '3 '4 '5 $$$ &&& 0-9 are self-evaluaters and
        ;; '6 '7 '8 '9               should not have been inclu-
        ;;                           ded here. Furthermore, this
        ;;                           entire variable could be a
        ;;                           system constant or omitted
        ;;                           entirely. <abc 13Jan89>
        ;; +++ Why is 'AD missing from this line!? <abc>
        'aa 'ab 'ac 'ae 'af 'ag 'ah 'ai 'aj
              .
              .
              .   )

The following tools are to be provided for entering CTS templates in Zwei buffers:

        Control-$       Inserts a "$$$"-style CTS template on the current line
        Control-@       Inserts a "@@@"-style CTS template on the current line
        Control-+       Inserts a "+++"-style CTS template on the current line
        Control-&       Inserts a "&&&"-style CTS template on the current line
                         (note this type of CTS should only go at the beginnings
                          of files.)


  B. ANNOTATING SYTEMATIC SOURCE CHANGES

     The intention of the above mechanism is that when a few, small,
localized changes are made to a file, they will be individually
annotated.  Systemic changes, however, do not usually lend themselves
to individual annotation.  In cases where many files are modified in
exactly the same way, the special CTS &&& is used inside a Left
Justified Long Comment at the top of each affected file (after the mode
line). For example,

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-*- Mode:LISP; Package:GLOBAL; Base:10 -*-                             |
;;; &&& This file contains the new version of KMAC:DONALD-HAD-A-FARM   |
;;; &&& This file contains the new version of LAMBDA:HAD-A-LITTLE-MARY |
                                                                       |
 :                                                                     |
 :                                                                     |
 :                                                                     |
 :                                                                     |
 :                                                                     |
 :                                                                     |
 :                                                                     |



  C. REMOVING COMMENTS FROM SOURCE FILES

     Most comments regarding changes to source code are intended to be
temporary. "Uninteresting" comments may be deleted from the source files
(without leaving a record of the deletion) after a suitable time period
has elapsed.  Naturally, this time period varies depending on the
comment.

     For comments regarding action items (e.g., "This function call
should be changed to a macro!" or "This code does not handle boundary
conditions properly!"), the CTS should be modified after the
appropriate steps have been taken with respect to the code.  In such
cases, a "$$$" CTS and comment should be left in place of the CTS and
comment that were replaced.

     A comment of "historical" interest only may become uninteresting
and therefore deletable after as little as three months, while other
motivational comments may remain an important part of the design record
for a longer period of time, possibly forever.

Mature discretion, strict adherence and limited flexibility are
implicit in any scheme for removing others' comments from code.
