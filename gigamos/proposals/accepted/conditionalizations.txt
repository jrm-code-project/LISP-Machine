                            Falcon Processor

                      (smh 8Aug88/revised 26Aug88)



SUMMARY:



     This proposal puts forth the starting point for a mechanism by
which a single set of Lisp system source files may be conditionalized
and maintained to compile and run on the Lambda, K, and other (known)
processors.




BACKGROUND:



 The Problem Introduced By The Cross Compiler


  While certain files implementing either low-level system functionality
or system-specific facilities may contain machine-dependent code (and
therefore must be maintained separately), the bulk of system files that
implement the LISP language and most LISP Machine tools are primarily
machine-independent in their coding.  This means that they require only
occasional conditionalization, when complete knowledge about either the
run-time target processor execution environment is unavailable at
code-writing/code-compilation time.  The existence and behavior of the
cross compiler, however, adds significantly to the complexity required
for a consistent conditionalizing mechanism.


 Run-Time Code Conditionalization


  When run-time parameters such as processor type and/or loaded system
options are unknown to the code writer, conditionalizations must be
written into the code itself to cover multiple contigencies.  One way of
providing such conditionalizations is to have code that explicitly
checks the status of the machine at run time.  This is a feasible
alternative if the condition being checked is something which cannot be
determined at compile time, such as whether a floating-point accelerator
exists on the machine which will run the code.

  However, run-time machine status has no bearing on processor type
conditionalization.  There is no reason for code written to run on a K
processor to test whether it is running on a Lambda.  This `test' is
performed implicitly at compile time.

  The normal way of invoking compile-time conditionalization is with the
read-time conditionalizers #+<FEATURE> and #-<FEATURE>.  These examine
whether :FEATURE is present on the system's *FEATURES* list.

  However, this mechanism is insufficient when conditionalizing for
cross compilation.  [Note: For the purposes of this discussion, a cross
compiler is invoked to compile code written on a SOURCE MACHINE, with
the intention that its compiled output code will be executed on a TARGET
MACHINE (or a simulation thereof).]  The conditionalization occurs at
read time on the source machine, and so the target machine never sees
any code that was not strictly source machine compatible.

  For further information on cross compiling and maintaining
target environments at compile time, see the information file named
"JB:PROPOSALS.BACKGROUND;CROSS-COMPILING.TEXT".



IMPLEMENTATION:



 An Extension To Run-Time Code Conditionalization


  A proposed extension to the #+ and #- reader macros would support
cross compilation for multiple target processors.  The TARGET macro
would understand a new keyword symbol which performs conditionalization
with regard to SI:*TARGET-FEATURES*.  This is best illustrated by an
example:

        (defconstant pi #+(target lambda)
                          ;; Use this value if running on a Lambda:
                          3.14285s0
                        #+(target falcon)
                          ;; Use this value if running on a Falcon:
                          22/7
                        #-(target (or lambda k))
                          ;; Use this value if running on neither:
                          3.1415926s0)

  The new variable *TARGET-FEATURES* contains a list of features, which
is consulted by the reader for #+(target ...) or #-(target ...)
constructs, in the same manner as it currently consults the *FEATURES*
list.  *TARGET-FEATURES* is bound by the cross compiler only.  If
*TARGET-FEATURES* is bound to NIL (its normal value), then the reader
will conditionalize on the source machine's features list (*FEATURES* on
the Lambda), rather than on *TARGET-FEATURES*.  Hence, TARGET-style
conditionalizations will may still be used outside of code that is being
cross-compiled.

  For completeness, the syntax #+(LOCAL ...) is also understood and
forces conditionalization to source machine compatibility.  It would be
used in the unlikely event that some feature or property of the source
machine were needed for a conditionalization occurring inside a
"#-LOCAL" (read, "To be compiled for a machine other than the source
machine") cross-compilation environment.



  The following table indicates the current initial values of the
local features lists for the Lambda and Falcon systems:




    Machine             Lambda          Falcon


    Feature List Name   *FEATURES*      COMPILER:*FALCON-FEATURES*


    Initial Features    :LAMBDA         :FALCON
                        :LEXICAL        :LEXICAL
                        :COMMONLISP     :COMMONLISP
                        :LOOP           :LOOP
                        :DEFSTRUCT      :DEFSTRUCT
                        :LISPM          :LISPM
                        :MIT            :MIT
                        :LMI            :LMI
                        :COMMON         :COMMON
                        :CHAOS          :CHAOS
                        :SORT           :SORT
                        :FASLOAD        :FASLOAD
                        :STRING         :STRING
                        :NEWIO          :NEWIO
                        :ROMAN          :ROMAN
                        :TRACE          :TRACE
                        :GRINDEF        :GRINDEF
                        :GRIND          :GRIND




  [Note that the initial Falcon Features list is identical to the
initial Lambda Features List, except that the ":LAMBDA" feature is
replaced by the ":FALCON" feature.]

  The conditionalization symbol used to ensure Lambda processor
compatibility on should always be #+LAMBDA.  The conditionalization
symbol for the Falcon (and all related processor names, such as "K" and
"Phoenix") should always be #+FALCON, as later versions of the Falcon
system may use a different conditionalization symbol.  Failure to
conform at this stage will add to the complexity of any future
switchovers.

  Certain functions are shared by the Lambda and Falcon compilers.  An
example of such code is the optimizer.  Such code should
use calls to ECASE to dispatch on the value of the variable
COMPILER:*TARGET-COMPUTER*, which will always have either the value
COMPILER::K or the value COMPILER::LAMBDA-INTERFACE.



OPEN ISSUES:



  It is still an open issue as to what sort of conditionalization scheme
should be used for conditionalizing on the various operating-system
hosts possible.  Such conditionalization could occur either at compile
time or at run time.  Since space is at a premium, compile-time
conditionalization would seem to be preferable.

  Also open is the scheme for actually indicating that a
conditionalization is to occur in code.  The current scheme rests on the
shoulders of the programmer the entire burden of ensuring that the
layout of the code makes clear to future human readers the intent of the
conditionalization.  The current "#+" and "#-" scheme has the
disadvantage of having an implicit "(WHEN x y)" (or, worse, in the case
of #-, a "(WHEN (NOT x) y)" control structure.  It would clearly be
preferable to employ an "(IF x y z)" control structure of some kind.
Such a conditionalization scheme would be general (just as an IF
statement without a third clause is semantically equivalent to a WHEN
clause).

  Ideally, of course, would be something which had as its implicit
control structure something similar to

      (ECASE processor-variable
        (x ...)
        (y ...)
        (z ...)
        .
        .
        .)

One restriction worth noting for such a scheme is that the LISP reader
must be prohibited from reading or interning any objects in the
non-pertinent clauses.  This essentially means that any such mechanism
would have to be built *around* LISP's parenthesis structure, just as
with the "#" mechanism.
