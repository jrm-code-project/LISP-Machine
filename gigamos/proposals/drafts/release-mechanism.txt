Internal Release Schedule GigaMos Systems, Inc.

This document the internal release schedule that will be followed during
the Falcon software development. The goals of this release schedule are
to provide a backup of critical work, to minimize the amount of change
between system compilations and to insure a consistent working
environment for the technical staff.

The K software currently is completely contained in a "K" directory and
is named by a Lisp machine logical pathname. By redefining the logical
pathname any given developer can use a different set of K sources and
binaries.

Making a release of the "K" software will consist of making a copy of
the complete "K" hierarchy to a new directory.

Compiling a release of the "K" software will consist of recompiling all
of the lisp files in a given "K" hierarchy.

The main line of development will always be in a given directory
("JB:K;") and will NOT change.

The mechanism for generating a release of the K system software involves
running the function (make-k-system-release host version). Host is the
name of the host on which the release is being created (We are currently
using JB) and version is the version number of the release. To find the
current version number one can edit JB's root directory and look for
directories beginning with "K-" the highest numbered version is the
current release.  To create the next version call make-k-system-release
with the number of the version YOU WANT TO CREATE. Of course this
release should be done when the sources in the development directory are
quiescent, i.e. this means the last person to leave on Friday night will
do the release.

Compilations are more tricky since you don't want to recompile the
released version and you don't want to risk stopping development by
recompiling sources in the development directory. The current solution
to this problem will involve making another copy of the sources for a
trial compilation in a directory of the person doing the compilations
choice.  Once he is sure that the monthly compilation is correct he will
then start a compilation of the entire system in the development
directory.

The functions used in performing a recompilation are in order:
(load-k-system :recompile) (mega-boot :compile-type :recompile) For now
it is necessary to recompile on a machine with a lambda installed.

After the system has been recompiled in a test directory, the regression
test suite will be run.  When the regression test suite is passed the
software in the development directory can be recompiled.  If more than a
week has elapsed between the start of the compilation process in the
test directory and passing of the regression test suite the process must
start all over.

Due to the limitations on disk space, we will keep online only those
sources that a less than 3 months old or that have been given
distinctive rather than numeric names.  An example would be
"K-DECEMBER-DELIVERABLE" which would only be deleted after discussion
with the creator.
