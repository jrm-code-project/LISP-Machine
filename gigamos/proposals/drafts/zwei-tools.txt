ZMACS KEYSTROKES:

  COMPILING/DISASSEMBLING:

    Hyper-Shift-c       Fleabit compile and download (w/ numeric
                          arg, show (debug :post); with neg arg,
                          send to COMPILER-OUTPUT)

    Hyper-Super-c       Fleabit disassemble (:post debug) and
                          send to the COMPILER-OUTPUT buffer

    Hyper-c             Same as #\hyper-shfit-c except that not
                          downloaded

    Hyper-m             Fleabit macro expand (needs numeric arg
                          option for sending output to a buffer,
                          "MACRO-EXPAND-OUTPUT")

    Hyper-Shift-M       Recursive Fleabit macro expand (not yet
                          implemented)

  INSERTING COMMENTS:

    Control-$           Inserts a "$$$"-style CTS template on
                          the current line

    Control-@           Inserts a "@@@"-style CTS template on
                          the current line

    Control-+           Inserts a "+++"-style CTS template on
                          the current line

    Control-&           Inserts a "&&&"-style CTS template on
                          the current line (note this type of
                          CTS should only go at the beginnings
                          of files.)

CODING PRACTICES:

A function beginnning with the character "%" may violate storage
conventions, and it is incumbent upon the user to use the func-
tion with this knowledge.

Any formal parameter beginning with the character "%" indicates
that the parameter is assumed to obey the restrictions described
in the accompanying documentation.

For example:

(defun %set-internal (%symbol value)
  "Will let you bash T and NIL.  Assumes %SYMBOL is a symbol."
  (store-contents-offset %symbol *symbol-value* value))
