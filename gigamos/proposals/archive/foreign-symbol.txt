A. INTRODUCTION:

To continue my effort toward rebuilding the Lambda software, I need a
mechanism that allows references to "foreign" (processor-specific) symbols to
be accessed and compiled independently of actual knowledge of the symbols at
compile time.

Currently, compiling system files that refer to foreign symbols -- notably,
symbols located in packages that are not known to the compile-time processor
during compilation -- causes an error and produces erroneous symbol
references.

This problem was first encountered when compiling the compiler, on and for
the Lambda, after patches had been made to accomodate the cross-compiler.
But the problem could become more general during the Falcon software port;
the potential for trouble occurs whenever Lambda system files refer to
symbols in Falcon packages that are not known to the Lambda.

The existing customization mechanisms do not address such situations.  Other
alternatives have been discussed, and the following appears to be the
"cleanest" and most agreeable solution.

The code in Example 1 (below) illustrates the problem.  This will not compile
successfully on the Lambda unless the Falcon packages are defined.  For
various reasons it is NOT desirable to force the system maintainers to load
the Falcon software in order to compile the Lambda system software in place.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example 1:  Direct Reference to Foreign Symbols
1
 (do-something-with
  (if (eq *target-computer* 'k)
      #+lambda k-array:art-q
      #+falcon array:art-q
     ''art-q))*
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using the read-time #+TARGET mechanism will not help either; the problem is
to compile a reference to the symbol, relative to the target computer that is
known at run-time.

B. PROPOSAL:

The thrust of the proposed solution is to maintain a database of foreign
symbols that can be retrieved as a function of processor type and a tag, such
as a keyword.

The macro DEF-FOREIGN-SYMBOL will be used to enter a processor-specific
symbol/tag entry.  Note that a compiled file containing such definitions can
make use of read-time constructs such as #+LAMBDA and #+(TARGET LAMBDA); but
the mechanism will not require definitions to be centralized in any way.

The function FOREIGN-SYMBOL, given the tag and processor type (e.g.  :LAMBDA
or :FALCON), will locate the desired symbol reference. The compiled call to
FOREIGN-SYMBOL is kept separate from the definition of the foreign symbol
provided by each processor.  The actual symbol need not be known when the
call to FOREIGN-SYMBOL is compiled. It seems consistent with normal variable
usage to expect that the required foreign symbols be entered in the database
before they are referenced by run-time code.  An error will be signalled if
an undefined foreign symbol is referred to at run-time.

Example 2 shows how the earlier code example would be fixed.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example 2:  Abstract Reference to Foreign Symbols

A.1: Define the Lambda version, e.g., in "SYS:SYS;TYPES":

1   #+lambda
   (def-foreign-symbol :art-q 'ZL:ART-Q)*

A.2: Define the Falcon version elsewhere:

1   (def-foreign-symbol :art-q*
                          1#+lambda 'K-ARRAY:ART-Q*
                          1#+falcon 'ARRAY:ART-Q)*

B: Refer to the foreign symbol:

1  (do-something-with (foreign-symbol :art-q))*

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

C. IMPLEMENTATION:

The run-time database will be established as a global variable, probably
associated with the compiler software.  The database will be a hash table,
indexed by foreign symbol tag (keyword).  Each element of the table will be a
property list indexed by processor symbol.

Steve suggested using a hash table for performance reasons.

FOREIGN-SYMBOL, aside from error handling, is just:

        (GETF (GETHASH <tag> <*table*>) <processor>)

For the convenience of the cross-compiler, the target interface symbol --
e.g. LAMBDA-INTERFACE -- will be used as the index, rather than the processor
code such as :LAMBDA.  Other applications of this technique would perform the
standard mapping of processor symbol to target interface.

DEF-FOREIGN-SYMBOL  does a SETF of FOREIGN-SYMBOL with its arguments.

D. ISSUES:

Source-file recording and redefinition warning could be handled by
DEF-FOREIGN-SYMBOL as appropriate.

Bob suggested that I provide a handy Zwei command to List Foreign Symbols,
displayed in sort order by tag, with columns for each processor.

E. PLEASE REVIEW THIS PROPOSAL!

The developmental version of the FOREIGN-SYMBOL macro will be located in the
file DJ:KEITH;FOREIGN-SYMBOL.  I will be testing this in a "live" system
file, the cross-compiler's "SYS:SYS;QCOPT.LISP".  This should alert me fairly
quickly to any major flaws in this strategy.

[Note: Steve, where should these functions live in the sources? -- Keith]
