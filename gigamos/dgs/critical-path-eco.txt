It has come to light that there is a critical timing path violation in
the K processor design that may possibly introduce errors when reading
values from some functional sources using an instruction which is not
in cache.

The failure was first noticed in conjunction with the cold boot function
which causes a debugger trap by performing a NuBus write to the interrupt
register of the K processor on the NuBus.  In determining the address of
the interrupt register (and thus the destination of the write), the function
combines the slot number of the K memory board with an offset associated
with the interrupt register.  The function reads the slot number from a
field of the Memory Status register, but in some cases the function got
an incorrect slot number from the status register.

Analysis of the problem revealed that the data from the Memory Status
register had not stabilized on the MFI bus at the time of the strobing
clock edge when the instruction reading the register had to be fetched
from DRAM, although it would work if the instruction had been in cache.

The reason for the difference is that the MFI bus is commandeered during
cache misses to pass instruction data between the memory system and the
cache as the cache line is filled.  Once the cache line has been filled,
the MFI bus is re-deployed as a data path to the ALU input registers.
Propagation delays associated with the re-deployment of the MFI bus as
an ALU source added to propagation delays between the Memory Status
register and the ALU exceed (in the worst case) the clock cycle time of
80 nS.  More specifically, the cache-line-fill FSM asserts JAMHIT at the
conclusion of a cache line fill, which negates ICACHE-LOAD, which negates
DISABLE, which asserts R-MEMSTATUS and MFIO-IN, which enable the Memory
Status data through the MFIO drivers, then through the MFIO->MFI buffers,
then through the MFI multiplexer, and finally setup on the left and right
ALU operand registers.  The numbers follow:

          -> MFI valid                       F244           5     8
          -> MFI-MUX outputs valid           F157           5     7
          -> setup time on L/R registers     F399           3     3
                                                          ----  ----
                                                           78   111  nS

The immediate problem was solved by extending the clock period from 80 nS
to 91 nS by substituting a 44 MHz oscillator for the 50 MHz oscillator
called for in the design.  However this adjustment still does not
accommodate worst-case conditions, and the basic propagation path applies
as well to other functional sources within the machine -- the Trap
register, the Statistics counter and microsecond clock, the Memory Control
Register, the GC and MAP memories, and the VMA and MD.

The largest single component of the cited delay chain is contributed by
the LS244 driver component, which for other reasons as well was an
unfortunate choice.  By substituting a 74F244 for these devices, the
probability of trouble from this path would be all but eliminated.

Among the remaining functional sources, the VMA, the Trap Register,
and the Memory Control register also use LS-series drivers in virtually
identical propagation paths.  RG has proposed that all these devices be
replaced with corresponding FAST devices, in order that no worst-case
critical-path violations of this sort should remain in the design.

The affected devices include:
