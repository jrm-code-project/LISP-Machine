The width of the write pulse to the K Processor's register stack was determined
purely as a function of component propagation delays in the board implementation.
Of course, this results in problems.  In the case at hand, the problem is that
the write pulse is significantly narrower than the memory devices' minimum
spec'ed write pulse width.  I broadened the pulse slightly by inserting an
additional gate delay in the feedback path that terminates the pulse, but
I noticed last week a board with an eleven nanosecond write pulse, including
the added component delay.  Something more appropriate needs to be done.

How would it be if we just removed the feedback path B16.6 -> D7.13,12,11 ->
C13.10?  (Presumably this is where the present design came from.)  In this
configuration, the danger is that the address will change before the write
pulse terminates.  Note that EC2-PROC2* gates both the write pulse and
the C2-REGA clock (which, in turn, clocks the registers addressing the array).
Address hold time after write is zero for the RAM devices, so this
configuration works as long as Tpd(min) of the AS805 sourcing C2-REGA, plus
Tpd(min)C->Q of the address registers exceeds Tpdlh(max) of the AS20
that drives the write line to the RAM array.  (Both the address lines and the
write line are equally loaded.)  Tpd(min) is 3 nS for the F399's, 1 nS for
the AS805.  Tpdlh(max) for the AS20 is 5 nS.  In the worst case, we lose
by a nanosecond, but in the typical case, I bet that we could squeak by.
Note that the AS805 has 13 loads on it, which should slow it down a
bit.
