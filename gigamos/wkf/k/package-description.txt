First the symbols which will be needed to bootstrap the K are created on
the Lambda.  This is done by loading the file named
"k-sys:k;package-definitions.lisp".  This is the very first thing
done in the 'Falcon make-system.


I. PACKAGE-DEFINITIONS.LISP

At the top of this file there are macro defintions of the form
PKG-XXX-IMPORTS.  These are followed by XXX-IMPORTS macro definitions.
Where XXX is a package from the following list:

        GLOBAL
        VINC
        PRIMS
        CLI
        CONS
        ARRAY
        NEW-MATH
        SYMBOL

The PKG-XXX-IMPORTS macros return a list of package names.  This list of
package names represents the packages which import from XXX the list of
symbols represented by the XXX-IMPORTS macros as a list of symbol names.

For example the PKG-CONS-IMPORTS expands into a list of packages names which
should import from CONS the list of symbols whos names into which CONS-IMPORTS
expands.

Specifically, currently for cons:

PKG-CONS-IMPORTS => ("LISP-INTERNALS")

CONS-IMPORTS     =>
(:import-from cons "RPLACA" "RPLACD" "CAAAAR" "CAAADR" "CAAAR"  "CAADAR"
                   "CAADDR" "CAADR"  "CAAR"   "CADAAR" "CADADR" "CADAR"
                   "CADDAR" "CADDDR" "CADDR"  "CADR"   "CAR"    "CDAAAR"
                   "CDAADR" "CDAAR"  "CDADAR" "CDADDR" "CDADR"  "CDAR"
                   "CDDAAR" "CDDADR" "CDDAR"  "CDDDAR" "CDDDDR" "CDDDR"
                   "CDDR"   "CDR"    "CONS"   "ENDP")

These symbols (above named as strings) are imported into the package named
"LISP-INTERNALS" from the package named "CONS".


TO BE DONE:

 Currently we do have duplicate imformation which could lead to possible
 future mistakes by changing only one.  That is the PKG-XXX-IMPORTS are
 not used for deciding which packages get the XXX-IMPORTS.  Instead each
 package definition which follows the two types of macros explicitly
 uses each set of imports approporiate to itself.  This is a little
 tedious but straight forward and should be done soon to avoid
 confusion.

After the macro definitions comes the package definitions.  I surveyed
these earlier and I believe that the USE structure is identical between
the lambda and K except for USEd packages which do not exist on the K
such as "KBUG-STREAMS".  The other difference is that a few packages
shadow some symbols on the lambda but not on the K and a few packages
imports some symbols explicitly (i.e. not using the XXX-IMPORTS macros)
on the lambda but not on the K.  These special cases I believe are not
going to change very much (since they have stayed constant for several
months since june) and can therefore be left alone, latter being flushed
since they are only on the lambda for purposes of cross-compilation.

The end of the file has some functions for creating the k-xxx packages.
This code has also not changed for a long time and will eventually be
flushed when we no longer are cross-compiling and debugging.

At this point after the file has been loaded the package structure of
the lambda is set.  Any new symbols will be created as files are loaded
and will be appropriately distributed via the pakcage USE structure.

The file "k-sys:k;imported-syms" imports and exports the common-lisp
symbols into the K-GLOBAL package.



II. WARM-INTERN

The symbols on the K are created BEFORE any package structure exists.
This creates complications in the process, making it somewhat obtuse.

As the cold, warm, and hot files are loaded, each symbol is eventually
downloaded and interned using the function WARM-INTERN defined in
"K-SYS:COLD;WARM-LOADER"

This process is slightly different for each stage:

During the COLD stage NO symbols exist on the K.  The symbols are stored
on the lambda and warm-downloaded after the cold boot.

During the WARM stage symbols are downloaded with a package name and
print name.  The print name is as it appeared in the defining file.  The
symbol is interned with a string for its package.  Only interning with
the same print-name and package-name returns the same symbol. The
package name, however, is a mapping on the home package of the symbol being
downloaded.  The function GET-SYMBOL-PACKAGE-NAME defined in
"k-sys:k;new-fasdump" does this mapping on the lambda, based on the
package structure of the lambda.  The symbol in question is looked up in
the package specified at the top of the file.  The SYMBOL-PACKAGE
function is applied to get the home package.  This mapping must be based
on the home package to preserve symbol identity where the symbol is
referenced from different packages.

  (if (= home-package "PRIMS")
      (cond ((symbol exists in "GLOBAL")
             "PRIMS")
            ((symbol exists in "LI")
             (home package of symbol with same name in "LI"))
            (t
             "GLOBAL"))
     (if (home-package exists)
         home-package
        "NIL"))
   ;;; nil for gensyms of which I beleive none are in boot sequence

The above mapping is clearly confusing, but since I have not seen any
problems associated with it recently I beleive it should rest as is.
The reason for this indirection is so that two different symbols on the
Lambda can be mapped to one symbol on the K.  (I don't remember specific
symbols which this applies too.)

Note: In the KBUG2 & KBUG debuggers when symbols are printed which have
 strings for their home package they are printed with <angle> brackets
 surrounding the package. (i.e. <LI>:WARM-BOOT)

During the HOT stage warm-intern calls regular li:intern.


III. WARM-BOOT

Finally, in WARM-BOOT which runs after the warm files are all loaded, we
create the actual packages with USE structure copied as in the
PACKAGE-DEFINTIONS file (Note: There is currently no enforcement of
consistency between the USE structure for packages on the K and their
associated packages USE structure on the lambda.)  Then each symbol
created during the warm boot (contained in the list gr:*warm-symbols*)
is interned in it's now existent home package, represented as a string
in the symbol, and that string is replaced by new package.  Next a list
of common-lisp symbols is imported and exported from the LISP package.
Also a list of zetalisp symbols is imported and exported form the GLOBAL
package.  Lastly, the imports specified by PACKAGE-DEFINTIONS file are
done.  First the unique symbol is located in its home or other package
it belongs in.  Once found it is imported into the correct packages and
its home package is set accordingly.
