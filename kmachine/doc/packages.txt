                              EFH 6/17/87



   This is a description of the modularity of K machine software in
terms of the packages it is contained in.  (In lisp a large system is
divided into modules called packages.  The interface to a module is
defined by the external symbols of the package).

 K
    K contains the symbols used in the assembler.  Packages in which
   assembly code is written should use this.

 HARDWARE, HW
    This package defines the extreme low level of the interface to the
   hardware.  If the hardware changes, this will, too.

 VINCULUM,VINC
    VINCULUM ("that which binds" or "glue") contains the software
   definitions that are firmly based on the hardware.  It isn't that the
   hardware determines these per se, but that the hardware was designed
   with these in mind.  It should be possible to change these without
   making ECO's, but it wasn't intended.

 PRIMITIVES, PRIMS
    PRIMS contains a subset of Common Lisp, both a subset of the
   functions and a subset of the functionality for individual functions.
   This is the subset which can be compiled directly into K Machine
   machine code.  PRIMS defines the language in which the lowest levels
   of the system is implemented.

 GLOBAL-REGISTERS,GR
    This package contains the names of the global registers.  These
   symbols are not imported into any other package, the package name is
   used explicitly to denote that a variable is contained in a global
   register.  These symbols could probably be in PRIMS instead.

 TRAP
 (vinculum prims k)
    This contains code to handle traps including saving the state of the
   machine and restarting.

 TIMERS
    This contains the code to handle timer traps.  (This could probably
   be part of TRAP).

 NUBUS-STUFF

 DATATYPE-RAM,DT-RAM
   Contains code to set up the datatype RAM for data type trapping.

 BOOT
 (vinculum virtual-memory prims k)
    BOOT contains the code which boots the machine including setting up
   the memory system.  Functions in this package reference other
   functions in the memory management packages below.


   The following 11 packages contain all the code which manages the
lowest levels of the virtual memory system, including details of
garbage collection.  They could probably be in one or two packages.

 MAP
    Contains constants and functions for dealing with the memory map at
   the lowest level.

 GC-RAM
  Contains functions which deal with the GC RAM.

 PAGING-DEVICES

 VIRTUAL-MEMORY,VMEM

 PHYSICAL-CLUSTER-DATA,PCD
 (virtual-memory vinculum prims)

 QUANTUM-MAP
 (virtual-memory vinculum prims)

 MEMORY-MANAGEMENT,MEM-LOW

 MAP-FAULT
 (virtual-memory physical-cluster-data map vinculum prims)
    Contains code which handles MAP faults (page faults, write to fresh
   page, write to read only, etc)

 GC-FAULT
 (map vinculum prims))

 MEMORY-MANAGEMENT-INTERFACE,MEM
 (vinculum prims)
    This just exports symbols from some other packages that define the
   user interface to the memory system.  This seems gratuitous.

 TRANSPORTER-RAM
 (vinculum virtual-memory prims)


  The next level of the memory system organizes the memory into areas
and regions.

 REGION-BITS
 (memory-management virtual-memory vinculum prims)

 REGION-DATA
 (memory-management vinculum prims))

 AREA-DATA
 (region-data memory-management vinculum prims)


   The next level of the memory system implements the lisp object and
typed pointer model of memory.

 CONS
 (memory-management-interface vinculum prims k)
    CONS contains functions for allocation, access and modification of
   lisp objects.  The exported symbols of this package (MAKE-POINTER,
   CONTENTS-OFFSET, CONS, CAR, SET-CAR, ALLOCATE-STRUCTURE etc.)
   constitute the interface to the lisp pointer and object memory system.


 NEW-MATH
   NEW-MATH contains the Common Lisp mathematical functions.

 ARRAY
   ARRAY contains the Common Lisp array functions.


 LISP-INTERNALS,LI
 (prims k)
      LI contains all of Common Lisp plus the internal functions used to
   implement the Common Lisp functions.


 SYMBOL
 (cons vinculum prims)
  Implementation of symbols.  This should probably be in LI.

 SETF
    SETF contains SETF and related functions.  This should probably be in
   LI.

 NLISP
    NLISP is a temporary name for LISP, the package which contains all of
   Common Lisp.




   Various debugger things.

 KBUG2-COMMON
 (vinculum prims k)
  definitions for KBUG2 and K2

 K-DEBUG
