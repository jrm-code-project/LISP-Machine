What is Common Lisp?

  1.  Common LISP consists of a set of EXPLICIT PRIMITIVES, IMPLICIT PRIMITIVES,
      UTILITY FUNCTIONS, CONSTANTS, VARIABLES, and TYPES and a specification of the
      behavior of these functions under certain circumstances.

      An example of an explicit primitive is CAR.
      An example of a utility function is MEMBER.
      An example of a constant is MOST-POSITIVE-FIXNUM.
      An example of a variable is *PRINT-PRETTY*.
      An example of a type is SYMBOL.

  2.  Common LISP is incomplete in that some of the primitives which Common
      LISP provides are not specified.  For example, the SETF macro causes
      (SETF (AREF <array> <index>) <new-value>) to change the contents of
      the array.  Because SETF expands into lisp code that modifies the array,
      there must be a primitive that can mutate the array.  Common LISP does
      not specify a primitive that can modify an array.

  3.  Common LISP is partially overspecified.  There are vestigal parts of things
      left hanging in Common LISP.  An example is the optional ENV argument to
      macroexpand.  It is there, but there is no way to examine, mutate, create
      or do anything with it.  Another example is MOST-POSITIVE-FIXNUM.  Since
      all Common LISP integer operators deal with FIXNUMs or BIGNUMs, there should
      be no reason for the user to need this constant.  In addition, there is
      no function he can call that will materially change the behavior of the machine if
      this number is passed as an argument.  What is it for?

  4.  Several functions in Common LISP do not specify what happens under boundary
      conditions.  What happens if LENGTH is called on a circular list?

  5.  Common LISP is vague.  *PRINT-PRETTY* specifies that the printer is to
      "insert extra whitespace where apropriate to make the expression more
       readable".

Basically, Common LISP is obviously an incomplete kludge.  The danger here is if
it turns into a complete kludge.  It is clear that some parts of Common LISP were
to be specified at a later date.  Maybe macroenvironments will be implemented, for
example.  The implementor has several choices to make as regards the unspecified
parts of Common LISP.  Common LISP may in the future specify these things, and if
the implementor has guessed wrong, he loses.

What is ZETALISP?

  1.  ZETALISP consists of a set of EXPLICIT PRIMITIVES,
      UTILITY FUNCTIONS, CONSTANTS, VARIABLES, and TYPES and a specification of the
      behavior of these functions under certain circumstances.

  2.  ZETALISP is complete in that all of the primitives which ZETALISP
      provides are specified (in the microcode).  For example, the SETF macro causes
      (SETF (AREF <array> <index>) <new-value>) to change the contents of
      the array.  Because SETF expands into lisp code that modifies the array,
      there must be a primitive that can mutate the array.  ZETALISP provides
      ASET.

  3.  ZETALISP is not overspecified, every part of ZETALISP is there for a
      purpose (albeit not always a good or even useful one).

  4.  ZETALISP is defined by the environment running on the LISP machine.

Our problem is that we have 10 megabytes of source in ZETALISP.  We cannot just
throw it away.  Our second problem is that some of ZETALISP will not run on the
K processor.  Please note that there is the danger that Common LISP will adopt
something that cannot run on the K.  There is nothing to be done about that, but
there may be some clout we could have if the K becomes popular.

We can divide ZETALISP into several classes of functions, constants,
variables and types.

  1.  Common LISP compatible:  Where ZETALISP and Common LISP behave identically.
      Code that is Common LISP compatible does not need any modification.

  2.  Common LISP orthogonal:  ZETALISP utilities that would run equally well
      under Common LISP.  Extra ZETALISP features.

  3.  Common LISP superset:  Where Common LISP specifies that "it is an error"
      to do some particular thing, ZETALISP allows such a thing.
      Example "It is an error if the array specified as the :displaced-to argument
      does not have th esame :element-type as the array being created."
      ZETALISP allows that and "does the right thing" (which, actually, it shouldn't
      as anyone using this kind of bagbiter is a loser anyway.)

  4.  Common LISP incompatible:  ZETALISP does something completely different.

  5.  K-machine incompatible:  Features that cannot work on the K.

What do we want to offer to customers?

  1.  A full Common LISP environment including the LISP, USER, KEYWORD, and
      SYSTEM package.  The LISP package is to include all symbols mentioned
      by Common LISP and all functions are to work as specified in Common
      LISP.  Any strict Common LISP program should run in this package.

  2.  A Common LISP extension package.  These are to be functions that will
      be written in Common LISP and will be supported indefinitely.  The sources
      should be available to the user and the user's code should remain
      portable if he brings the sources over also.

  3.  An object-oriented paradigm, probably Common LOOPS.

  4.  A ZETALISP compatability package.  These are to be functions that will
      be written in Common LISP, but perhaps not supported indefinitely.
      Portable code should be able to be written using these sources, but it
      should be discouraged.

  5.  An EMACS editor, a compiler, an inspector, a debugger, an interpreter (evaluator),
      job control, and a garbage collector.

  6.  A standard window system, when a standard is available.

What do we not want to offer to customers?

  1.  Any feature that we are not willing to support until the end of the world.
      Note that any feature that we add is likely to be used and will cost
      manpower to maintain.  We may also have compatability problems across
      systems when we finally abandon the K and move on to better things.

  2.  The internal system code.  This is not so much for "security purposes" but to
      protect ourselves from the customers who won't listen to "don't use this feature"
      warnings.  It may be true that we treat our customers like children, but
      unhappy customers generate less income than bug reports and pull down valuable
      programmers.  I would rather piss off a thousand RMS's than one MCC.

What this means for the system.

  Anything we want to put in the system that will work, we can!  This means we can
use flavors in the editor, we can keep the old window system, we can keep or flush
what we want.  The decisions on what to keep and what to flush should be based on
cost of maintenance only.

Abstraction
   Abstraction is the most powerful tool to reduce the complexity of a system
and make it understandable.  This is an amazingly simple concept that almost
everyone ignores totally.  They lose because of it.

Modularity
   A modular system is easier to maintain.  A modular system means that local
changes will not have global effects and that black box abstraction works.  This
means that working code will be less likely to break when other code is changed,
and that non-specialized people can maintian this code without having detailed
knowledge of the system.

Models
   All code should present an intuitive model of what is going on.  In some
cases, this is not possible, but in most of the cases, it is just not
documented.  It is difficult to get programmers to document their code, but
if we can get them to at least think about the model, the code may end up
more maintainable (this is weak.)

Familiarity
   All new code should be written in Common LISP to facilitate bringing new
programmers up to speed.

The BIG BOOJUMS

   ZWEI
   WINDOW SYSTEM
   FLAVORS
   JOB CONTROL
   RUBOUT HANDLER

Flavors
  The big problem with flavors is that people will be wanting to use Common LOOPS.
They are not incompatible (I think it is possible to implement Flavors as
a Common LOOPS meta-class).  Supporting two object oriented paradigms is not a
good idea.  Unfortunately, Common LOOPS is not complete and is unlikely to be
completed by the time we need it.
The right thing to do here is

  1) Abandon Flavors where they are not needed.  Object oriented paradigms
     provide two things:  generic operations and controlled inheritance.
     Some of the things that use flavors do not need this kind of power.
     Common LISP implementations should not use them.

  either
     2) Implement Flavors natively on the new machine.  Just do this to
        bring up the editor.  This isn't too hard (I don't think).  The advantage
        is that it is a known problem.

          or

     3) Implement Common LOOPS on the new machine and bring up flavors
        on top of it.   This may be hard (it may not, RPK would know).  The
        problem here is if the Common LISP community does not accept
        Common LOOPS (unlikely).

  eventually
    4)  Rewrite the parts of the code that use flavors to use the new
        object oriented paradigm whatever that might be.  This will not
        be too bad, one object oriented system is as good/bad as another, but
        it may involve some subtleties.  It will still be easier than
        maintaining 2 systems.   In the interim, we should figure out what
        to give the customers who are using flavors.  If we take on option
        3, we can just give them that.
