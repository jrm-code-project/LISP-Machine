BIGNUM File:
        Most of the problem I encountered are in instructions that try to
access memory using a pointer and an offset. Let us suppose that
register a0 has an offset and a1 a pointer. We can distinguish two
cases:

        (1) a0 has a boxed quantity. In this case, we must specify the
byte width of the instruction that adds the pointer and the offset, such
that we preserve the tag field of the pointer. The instruction for a
memory read would then be of the form:

        (alu L+R vma-start-read a0 a1 bw-24 [un]Boxed-vma [un]Boxed-md)

        Notice that the register with the pointer is used as the right
source of the alu. The result takes the top 8 bits from the right
source. Most of the bugs seens in the bignum files are of two folds: the
register containing the pointer is used as the left source, and the
width of the operation is unspecified. Since the width in bits over
which the operation is to be performed is unspecified, the result
contains a bogus tag that is the sum of the tags of the two operands. If
we are lucky we will error because of a transporter trap.

        (2) a0 has an unboxed quantity. In this case, provided that the
tag field of the offset is all zero, it is ok to use a bw-32 width, and
any order in the operands. The instruction can be written as follows:

        (alu L+R vma-start-read a0 a1 [un]Boxed-vma [Un]Boxed-md)

        I suspect that they are still some bugs in the bignum handlers.
Each function should be tested to make sure that bignum routines are
working. I think that I caught all the bugs in the function
BIGNUM-FIELD-PASS, although more testing of the routines will be
appropriate.

ARRAYS
        See documentation on array data structure from Rauen.

        There are two make-array functions : one (called make-array) is
CommonLisp and the other (called zl-make-array) is zeta-lisp compatible.
Most of the array functions listed in the Steele CommonLisp book are
implemented and can be found in one of the two files: ARRAY and ARRAY2.
Still to be done is ADJUST-ARRAY, ARRAY-PUSH-EXTEND.

        Most of the functions that initialize arrays and array leaders
have yet to be written. Also, Error checking at make-array time should
be reviewed. For example, CommonLisp arrays do not allow anything else
than another array to be the displaced-to argument to a make-array call.

        All array accessors lock the array. Someone should check each of
such functions and make sure that the array is unlock when exiting the
function, otherwise Sequence breaks will be inhibited forever.

K-UC-TV File:
        All the function that are in the microcode file uc-tv are
implemented in lisp for the K. A driver for character drawing has to be
written. The driver should check if the current drawing of a row pattern
from the font table will fit on a single word of wideo buffer memory, if
so call the fast version of character drawing, otherwise call the slow
version. The fast version has been tested but the slow version has not.
Global variables are used for caching the sheet's parameter and the font
characteristics. Some work still has to happen at this level. Things
like select sheet, decode font object etc...

        DrawLine, DrawRectangle, and BITBLT have been fully tested and
do work. May be it should be tried again just to make sure that every in
that file does what it is supposed to do. BITBLT uses a set of global
registers which are the K return registers, and that is ok since all the
subroutines do not use multiple values returns or if they do, never
glober the chosen registers. This is a decision that I made to make sure
that BITBLT is as fast as possible. AnyWay to use the code in the
K-UC-TV file, you must load also VCMEM-DRIVER file that contains the
code that initializes the VCMEM Board. All test functions are contained
in the test file "YOUCEF.K;tests".

NUBUS-INTERRUPTS FILE
        All addresses and data arguments for the functions accessing the
bus are unboxed. Virtual Cluster 4 is reserved for bus accesses. When
doing a bus access, one store bits 31-12 of the unboxed address in the
map entry associated with cluster 4, to setup the map.  Write the data
into the MD register if it is a write operation. Use the value of the
variable *bus-access-address* and the low 12 bits of the address to
generate the value to put into the VMA, and start the memory cycle. On
entry of all bus access, we make sure that the memory system if free for
use (we just try to access the MD register). Remember that to supply
byte addresses all the time.

        Byte accesses are supported as well as 16 bit accesses. For
either of these operations, one needs to setup the memory control
register to reflect the type of operation. For byte addresses, the last
two bits of the address determine which byte to read/write, and for 16
bit access, bit 1 of the address determines which low or high half to
use. For write operations, the data must be placed in the appropriate
place before the write. For read operations, the data must be picked out
of the right field from the contents of the MD. (for more details refer
to the code in the file "NUBUS-INTERRUPTS").

        In the file, there also exists a set of functions that allocate
space in virtual address space, without allocating any physical memory,
i.e., the physical space is non local to the K processor. A good example
is the video buffer.

WINDOW ORIENTED DEBUGGER
        To use the window oriented debugger for the k machine, you
should load:
        kbug-generic-patch
        kbug2-patch
        falcon-debugger

        All the commands that are available in regular kbug2 are
available in the window oriented debugger. The window oriented debugger.

        Register Display:
                Display routines for the register do work. The updating
of the window that display the open, active, and return registers is
done after each instruction when single stepping. Each boxed value is
mouse sensitive, unboxed values are not. A boxed value is indicated by a
star"*". Selecting a register and clicking right, pops
up a menu of choices.

        Lisp Object Display:
                The hex value displayed can be viewed as a lisp object
in the lisp object display window. If the type of the quantity is
unknown, or if the code to handle a data type in written yet, the window
displays "Unknown object". Lines describing an object can be expanded by
clicking on the line and collapsed by double clicking on the line. A
middle mouse click on a line will remove it from the display.

        Menu:
                Items in the menu are not handled properly by the
system. It needs more work. Kbug2 process is interfering when trying to
do a warm-boot or cold-boot while it is running.

        Memory Display:
                The display is like the show memory in kbug2. It
displays 16 memory location at a time. If the data type of the pointer
to memory is known, the code will try to access the lowest address
associated with the object at hand and display the next 16 words of
memory from there. So far it handles arrays.

        Call Stack window:
                Needs to be redone to display any call hardware
operations, like open, call and returns. I tried to have it only track
function calls which the wrong thing to do on the k machine.

        Lisp Listener or Rep loop:
                So far just calls the listener or rep loop. Nothing
special has been done to it.
