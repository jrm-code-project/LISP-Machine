   CATCH must dynamically bind an identifier to a continuation.
Since one of the elements of the continuation is the level of the
control stack it is usually convenient to deep bind the identifier
and mark the level of the stack by representing the binding and
continuation as a pseudo stack frame placed on the control stack.

  We use this technique by opening a frame and marking it by setting O0
to a special marker ('UNWIND-MARKER).  (This implies that no real
function should be passed this marker as its first argument).


  There are two binary decisions to be made when implementing CATCH,
resulting in four slightly different implementations.  They are:

  1. Should the body continuation and the throw continuation be
     the same?

  2. Should THROW pop the catch frame?


  Decision 1.  THROW returns its value in a canonical place,  if THROW
returns directly to the continuation of the body, then the body must
also return its value in the same canonical place.  The Lisp Machine
does this and the canonical place is the stack.  To return in a canonical
place would not be too bad for us either, except for multiple values.
Many implementations have VALUES look back on the stack for the number
of values needed and a place to put them.
In the general case we return multiple values in registers and set a bit which says multiple
values were returned.  If the target of the values is apparent
we can just move the values and not set the bit.
THROW must use the general case and the throw continuation must call MVBIND,
however, the body may be able to use the special case.  Therefore it seems
better to allow the throw continuation to add some special code which will only
be run when a throw occurs and then call the normal body continuation.
